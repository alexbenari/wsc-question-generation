In the 16th century, his distant (and also lushly-bearded) predecessor Filofei proposed (in letters to a young prince named Vassilij) that Russia could be the third Rome. Consider what he meant then and what the implications of his suggestion might be today, then discuss with your team: could there be another Rome in our own era, and would it be good for the world if there were? Would Greenland be part of it? Be sure to explore the following concepts: unipolarity vs. multipolarity | core vs. periphery | great vs. small powers controlling vs. client state | soft vs. hard power | foreign assistance Rome isn’t the only empire that keeps popping back up. Like certain movie franchises, a great empire can only fall once, but it can be revived—usually unsuccessfully—many times. Study the history of second chances at imperial grandeur. What were they trying to emulate or continue, and how close did they come to succeeding? Did any last longer than the regimes they sought to restart? Neo-Assyrian Empire | Song Dynasty | Byzantine Empire Carolingian Empire | Ottonian dynasty | Meiji Restoration Neo-Sovietism Destroyed buildings can also have second leases on life. Consider the following examples, then discuss with your team: is a reconstruction of a building a continuation or something altogether new? Bibliotheca Alexandrina | White House | Notre Dame | Basilica of Saint Paul Babylon | Shuri Castle | Yellow Crane Tower | Stonehenge | Shakespeare's Globe In Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, the great Galactic Empire is falling. Thirty thousand years of darkness and ruin await—even Palpatine couldn’t have lived that long—until a man who can predict the future using math comes up with a weird plan: a colony of librarians who, if left alone on the fringe of the known universe to write a great encyclopedia, could shorten the Dark Ages to a “mere” thousand years. Discuss with your team: would librarians be a good choice of profession for those entrusted to restart a great civilization? If not librarians, then who? And how much do you think math—and big data—can and should be used to predict the future? Sometime in 2025, a dead airline will return to the skies. A private company is planning to de-extinct the once-legendary airline brand Pan Am for some very expensive charter flights, with hints of bringing it back in a bigger fashion down the line. And, speaking of fashion, Pan Am has already been revived as a South Korean clothing brand. Consider the examples below of other brand names that have been brought back from the dead to sell new products and services–even if they are unconnected to the companies that spawned them. Discuss with your team: is this kind of branding dishonest, and what derelict brands or companies would you want to reintroduce–and in what forms? RCA | Westinghouse | Polaroid | RadioShack Gateway | Nokia | Sansui | Eastern Air Lines Could 3.5 inch floppy discs be next? (They do make good coasters.) From audio cassettes to instant cameras, many vintage technologies are enjoying a resurgence today, often driven by viral online trends that celebrate their limitations. Discuss with your team: why do some products and brands become popular again after gathering dust for so long? When do you prefer something older and (technically) worse to something newer and (technically) better? disposable cameras | handheld gaming devices | vinyl | film shortwave radio | AM radio | pager | magnetic tape storage | physical media De-extinction isn’t just for passenger pigeons, bankrupt brand names, and outdated technologies. Artistic and musical can be brought back, sometimes unsuccessfully—and sometimes, perhaps, too successfully. Discuss with your team: is it true that old music is killing new music?",

      "text": "In 2025, the Pan American (Pan Am) brand will make a brief return through a nostalgic travel experience organized by Centurion Travel, a US-based agency. This venture will utilize a chartered Boeing 757, configured with 50 business class seats, to recreate classic Pan Am routes across the Atlantic. The airline, once a symbol of luxury air travel, was a pioneer in the industry but ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1991 after failing to compete effectively in a changing market.\n\nThe planned excursion will take place from June 27 to July 9, 2025, starting in New York and including stops in Bermuda, Lisbon, Marseille, London, and Foynes, Ireland. The itinerary reflects historical Pan Am routes, particularly highlighting cities that were significant to the airline's operations. The trip is priced at $65,500 per person, covering accommodations, travel, and most meals, thus targeting affluent travelers seeking a unique and luxurious experience.\n\nCraig Carter, CEO of Pan American World Airways LLC, which holds the rights to the Pan Am brand, emphasizes the venture as a reminder of the \"Golden Age of travel,\" contrasting it with the current commodification of air travel. The experience aims to evoke nostalgia for a time when flying was considered a glamorous journey rather than merely a means of transportation. However, details regarding the specific Boeing 757 to be used and whether it will feature any Pan Am livery remain unconfirmed.\n\nWhile the revival is framed as a one-time event, it raises questions about the potential for future endeavors under the Pan Am name. The choice of the Boeing 757 is particularly notable, as Pan Am never operated this aircraft model during its original tenure. The collaboration with a charter airline, rumored to be New Pacific Airlines, has not been officially confirmed, leaving some aspects of the operation shrouded in uncertainty."

      "text": "The South Korean fashion retailer SJ Group has revitalized the iconic Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) brand by transforming it into a lifestyle brand. This initiative marks the opening of the first Pan Am store in South Korea, located in the Shinsegae Starfield Coex Mall. The store features a range of Pan Am-branded products, including fashion apparel, accessories, and travel-related items, all designed to blend style with functionality. The store's design prominently incorporates Pan Am's signature blue and white colors, reflecting the airline's historical branding.\n\nFollowing the initial store launch, SJ Group plans to open a flagship location in Seongsu-dong, an area known for its trendy cafes and restaurants, on September 2. This flagship store will span 330 square meters and will include collaborations with local artists and brands, such as Nuri Yeon and Playmobil. SJ Group's strategy includes expanding Pan Am's presence in South Korea with plans for a total of 13 stores across various locations, including major department stores in Daejeon, Pangyo, and Busan.\n\nPan Am, founded in 1927, was once the largest international airline and a symbol of American aviation during the 20th century. Its legacy continues to resonate in popular culture, evidenced by its portrayal in television series and films, such as the 2011 drama named after the airline and the movie \"Catch Me If You Can.\" The rebranding effort by SJ Group aims to capitalize on this nostalgia while appealing to contemporary consumers through lifestyle products.\n\nThe revival of Pan Am as a lifestyle brand reflects broader trends in retail, where historical brands are reimagined to attract new markets. By leveraging Pan Am's storied past and integrating it into modern fashion and lifestyle contexts, SJ Group seeks to create a unique shopping experience that resonates with both older fans of the brand and younger consumers looking for stylish, functional products."

      "text": "Sales of cassette tapes in the UK have experienced a notable resurgence, reaching levels not seen since 2003. This trend parallels the revival of vinyl records and is largely driven by nostalgia and a desire for tangible music formats. The article explores various perspectives from individuals who have embraced cassette tapes, highlighting their unique appeal compared to modern digital music consumption methods.\n\nMany enthusiasts appreciate the tactile experience of cassettes, which require listeners to engage more fully with the music. For example, one reader noted that the inability to skip tracks creates a more intentional listening experience, allowing for a deeper connection with the album as a whole. This sentiment is echoed by others who find joy in the physicality of handling tapes and the satisfaction of receiving limited-run releases from independent artists.\n\nThe article also touches on generational connections, with parents sharing their love for cassettes with their children. One mother described how her daughter enjoys listening to classic bands on cassettes, reinforcing the format's nostalgic value and its role in fostering family bonds through shared musical experiences. Additionally, some users claim that cassettes offer a richer sound quality compared to CDs, despite acknowledging that this perception may not be technically accurate.\n\nOverall, the revival of cassette tapes reflects a broader cultural trend towards valuing physical media and the unique experiences they provide. As consumers seek alternatives to the digital music landscape dominated by streaming services, cassettes offer a nostalgic, engaging, and often more personal way to enjoy music. This resurgence raises questions about the future of music consumption and the enduring appeal of analog formats in an increasingly digital world."

      "text": "The article explores the surprising **resurgence of instant photography**, particularly Polaroid-style film, as a cultural phenomenon driven by nostalgia, aesthetics, and a renewed craving for tangible experiences. Once thought obsolete after Polaroid’s 2001 bankruptcy and the dominance of digital cameras, instant film has found new life among millennials and Generation Z. Companies like Fujifilm now lead the market, selling millions of Instax cameras annually—part of a broader revival of analog media that mirrors vinyl’s comeback. These trends suggest that physical, imperfect formats provide emotional value that digital perfection cannot replicate.\n\nPhotographers and enthusiasts often cite the **appeal of imperfection** as a key reason for embracing instant film. The grainy, idiosyncratic images create a sense of authenticity and presence that pristine digital photos lack. Many artists find that film forces them to slow down, think critically, and appreciate each shot. The tactile act of holding a photograph—the immediate, physical proof of a captured moment—imbues the experience with meaning beyond what a file on a screen can offer. In this way, instant photography becomes not just a technical process but a mindful, creative ritual.\n\nWhile some critics attribute the trend to **nostalgia**, particularly among millennials who grew up with Polaroids and vinyl records, the revival also reflects a broader cultural desire to resist digital saturation. Even though apps mimic Polaroid effects digitally, the longing for something real and imperfect persists. Yet nostalgia alone doesn’t explain the trend’s endurance, especially as Generation Z—too young to remember the original Polaroid era—has become a major consumer base.\n\nFor Gen Z, instant photography functions as a form of **self-expression and individuality**. Fujifilm designed the Instax line with this demographic in mind, marketing it as playful, fashionable, and personal. Younger users value the uniqueness of each photo and are willing to pay premium prices for experiences that feel authentic and expressive. Whether fueled by memory, creativity, or rebellion against digital uniformity, the Polaroid revival signals a cultural shift: a yearning for art and media that can be held, felt, and imperfectly remembered."

      "text": "Digital cameras from the early 2000s are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, particularly among younger generations, driven by a trend on social media platforms like TikTok. Over the past year, videos tagged with #digitalcamera have garnered over 220 million views, indicating a significant interest in these retro devices. This revival is seen as part of a broader cultural trend where nostalgia for early 2000s aesthetics parallels the resurgence of vintage fashion. Users like Scott Ewart, who has amassed millions of likes on TikTok, express that these cameras evoke comforting memories of childhood and simpler times, contrasting with the ease of smartphone photography.\n\nThe increased interest in vintage digital cameras is reflected in online marketplace activity. eBay reported a 13% rise in searches for \"vintage digital camera\" and a 52% increase for \"refurbished camera\" in late 2022. Etsy, known for handmade and vintage items, has also seen a surge, with over 19,000 digital camera-related listings. This trend highlights a growing consumer desire for tangible, nostalgic technology that offers a different photographic experience compared to modern smartphones.\n\nUsers like Katie Glasgow, who utilizes her parents' old cameras, describe the unique qualities of images produced by these devices. The \"blurry and imperfect\" photos resonate with younger audiences, creating a sense of nostalgia for moments they may not have directly experienced. This sentiment is echoed by Paul Greenwood from the creative agency We Are Social, who notes that as individuals enter their twenties, they often seek comfort in cultural artifacts from their youth, especially during times of societal uncertainty.\n\nThe appeal of older digital cameras lies in their perceived authenticity and the intentionality they require from users. Unlike smartphones, which allow for unlimited captures, these cameras encourage users to thoughtfully select moments to preserve, fostering a deeper connection to the memories they create. This trend reflects a broader search for authenticity in a digital age characterized by overwhelming content and a desire for genuine experiences."

      "name": "old music is killing new music",
      "text": "Ted Gioia’s essay argues that **new music is losing ground to old music** at an unprecedented rate. According to data from MRC, songs more than 18 months old now account for **70 percent of the U.S. music market**, and that share is still growing. The 200 most popular new tracks represent less than 5 percent of total streams, while physical and digital sales are increasingly dominated by classic acts like The Police and Creedence Clearwater Revival. Once, hit songs reflected the present moment; now even younger audiences favor decades-old music, turning new releases into background noise with little cultural impact.\n\nGioia attributes this decline to a **collapse of innovation within the music industry itself**. Major record labels and investors are channeling money into acquiring publishing rights to old catalogs—Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie—rather than developing new artists. Radio and streaming algorithms reinforce this stagnation, repeatedly serving up familiar hits and discouraging experimentation. Legal threats, especially after high-profile copyright lawsuits, have made executives wary of accepting new material, further shrinking opportunities for emerging musicians. Even genres once defined by disruption—rock, jazz, hip-hop—have been domesticated by formulaic programming and corporate caution.\n\nThis conservatism, Gioia argues, reflects the same mindset that cripples large corporations: a fear of risk and an obsession with protecting legacy products. The result is a **feedback loop of nostalgia**—old songs reissued on vinyl, old artists revived as holograms, and playlists designed to comfort rather than challenge. The Grammy Awards’ plunging viewership, he notes, symbolizes how detached mainstream institutions have become from contemporary creativity. Meanwhile, young musicians struggle for visibility, relegated to anonymous placements in ads or algorithmic playlists that strip away identity and context.\n\nYet Gioia ends on a note of **qualified optimism**. Historically, musical revolutions—from rock and roll to hip-hop—have never come from the center of the industry but from the margins. Innovation thrives when gatekeepers stop paying attention. He predicts that new music will once again erupt from unexpected places, outside the algorithms and boardrooms that currently stifle it. For now, though, the industry’s faith in the vitality of new sound has faded—leaving listeners to wonder whether nostalgia has truly become pop culture’s dominant note."
