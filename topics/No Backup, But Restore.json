  "material": "No Backup, But Restore Some creative works—including film, theatrical productions, and even novels—fail at the first go, but are then reworked in new ways months, years, or even decades later, in hopes that they can find that missing spark. Consider the musical Ragtime as an example of this kind of rebuilding project, then explore the selections below. In which cases did the new version of a project succeed where the first hadn’t? Should the early incarnations of a piece be studied alongside those that succeeded later, or left in the dustbin of history? Ragtime | “Wheels of a Dream” (1998) vs. “Wheels of a Dream” (2009) Martin Guerre | “I Will Make You Proud” (1994) vs. “Justice Will Be Done” (1999) Mulan | “Reflection” vs “Written in Stone” (1998) Alanis Morissette | “Ironic” (1995) vs “Ironic” (2015) K.D. Lang | “Surrender” (1997) vs. Sheryl Crow | \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997) Billy Joel | “We Didn’t Start The Fire” (1989) vs Fall Out Boy | “We Didn’t Start the Fire” (2023) “Liberally mix major and minor scales and lydian mode,” one blogger advises anyone on a (five-or-more-minute) mission to write music with a science fiction flavor. What do these terms mean, and Is there such a thing as a “future” riff—a musical shortcut that helps to set a time and place, but in this case for a time and place that haven’t happened yet? Be sure to consider the song “A TV Show Called Earth” and to discuss with your team: does the songwriter choose to make it sound alien or futuristic—and, if so, how? Blocks fall from above in various configurations as this iconic music plays: the Japanese composer Hirokazu Tanaka’s original soundtrack for Tetris is a classic of the genre. Discuss with your team: should we be creating more of this chiptune music today? Continue your exploration of the history of video game music, then discuss with your team: is video game music a legitimate form of art? And would music, and literature and art in general, benefit from more limitations such as those imposed by low-powered processors and audio capabilities on early video games—or from fewer? Some people’s fingers whirl across the screen tapping and flicking with uncanny efficiency; others hesitate, or aim and miss, or fire at things that aren’t there. Rhythm games are a great source of entertainment, but they can also help people with injuries—or even brain damage—rebuild their motor and mental skills. Consider their broader history of rhythm games, learn more about (and hopefully play!) the examples below, and then discuss with your team: how could rhythm games be used in schools for educational purposes? What kind of rhythm game would you design if you wanted to create a popular product? And could rhythm games be changing how future music is composed and appreciated?

      "text": "The article discusses the Broadway revival of the musical \"Ragtime,\" which premiered in November 2009, contrasting it with the original production that opened in 1998 and was deemed a financial failure. The revival, staged at the Neil Simon Theatre, is characterized by a more streamlined and focused approach, featuring a 28-piece orchestra and a cast of 40, which reflects the musical's expansive narrative drawn from E.L. Doctorow's historical novel. The revival's director, Marcia Milgrom Dodge, emphasizes movement and energy, particularly in the opening number, which showcases the diverse characters of early 20th-century America.\n\nThe narrative of \"Ragtime\" intertwines three main storylines: the lives of a wealthy white family in New Rochelle, immigrant experiences, and the struggles of African Americans in Harlem, particularly through the character of Coalhouse Walker Jr., who seeks justice for his love, Sarah. The revival effectively condenses Doctorow's complex plot while maintaining the essence of the historical figures that appear throughout the story, such as Emma Goldman and J.P. Morgan. The production's set design, featuring a singular, versatile stage, allows for seamless transitions between different settings, enhancing the storytelling.\n\nThe performances are highlighted, particularly Christiane Noll's portrayal of Mother, which is noted for its depth and emotional resonance. The article points out that while some cast members, like Stephanie Umoh as Sarah, may not reach the same vocal heights as their predecessors, the overall ensemble is strong. The revival is described as having a darker, more grounded tone compared to the original, which was criticized for its overly optimistic portrayal of the era.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes that the 2009 revival of \"Ragtime\" is better suited to contemporary audiences, reflecting a blend of nostalgia and realism that resonates with the complexities of modern society. The production's ability to balance historical context with emotional depth earns it a high grade, indicating a successful reimagining of a once-flawed musical."

Additionally, she encourages composers to explore unrelated keys frequently, particularly those that evoke a sense of otherness, without the need for traditional modulation techniques.\n\nThe article also highlights the significance of orchestration, recommending the use of brass instruments for heroic fanfares and French horns for soaring melodies. Fenoughty stresses the value of dynamic contrasts, suggesting that sudden shifts from very loud to very soft passages can enhance the dramatic impact of the music. Furthermore, she introduces the concept of \"acousmetre,\" which refers to sounds that evoke feelings of unease or alienation, thereby enriching the otherworldly atmosphere of science fiction scores.\n\nFinally, she advises composers to embrace mechanical and repetitive counterpoint to reflect futuristic technologies, reinforcing the genre's themes.

      "text": "The article \"Music Games: Potential Application and Considerations for Rhythmic Training\" by Valentin Bégel et al. explores the intersection of music games and rhythmic training, particularly in the context of rehabilitation for individuals with motor and cognitive impairments. The authors highlight the inherent human ability to synchronize movements to musical rhythms, which is linked to various cognitive functions such as language and memory. They argue that rhythmic training can be beneficial for improving motor performance and cognitive skills, especially in patients with conditions like Parkinson's disease, dyslexia, or ADHD. The review assesses existing music games to determine their suitability for rhythmic training, noting that while many games are available, they often lack the necessary precision and focus on rhythmic skills.\n\nThe authors categorize the games based on their design and functionality, examining how well they meet the criteria for effective rhythmic training. They identify several types of games, including those that involve full-body movements, rhythmic finger tapping, and singing in synchrony with music. However, they find that most existing games do not adequately measure rhythmic precision or provide feedback on performance, which limits their effectiveness as training tools. For instance, dance games may promote physical activity but do not specifically train rhythmic skills, while tapping games often suffer from poor timing precision and lack informative feedback.\n\nDespite these limitations, the authors suggest that certain features of existing games could inform the development of more effective rhythmic training protocols. They propose guidelines for creating serious music games that could better target rhythmic skills, emphasizing the importance of precise timing in stimulus presentation and response recording. The review indicates that integrating rhythmic training into game design could enhance rehabilitation efforts and improve cognitive and motor functions in various patient populations.\n\nIn conclusion, while current music games have significant shortcomings in their ability to train rhythmic skills effectively, the authors see potential for future development. By leveraging the engaging nature of games and the therapeutic benefits of rhythmic training, there is an opportunity to create innovative tools that could aid in rehabilitation and cognitive enhancement. The article calls for further research and development in this area to realize the full potential of music games in therapeutic contexts."

      "text": "The history of rhythm games traces their evolution from early experiments in interactive music to a diverse genre that has significantly impacted gaming and popular culture. The genre's origins can be linked to Nintendo's _Dance Aerobics_ in 1987, which introduced timing-based gameplay combined with music. This foundational concept was further developed in 1996 with the release of _Beatmania_ and _PaRappa the Rapper_, both of which established key gameplay mechanics that would define the genre. _Beatmania_ introduced a DJ booth-style control system, while _PaRappa the Rapper_ emphasized player improvisation and unique artistic style, setting the stage for the rhythm game boom.\n\nThe late 1990s saw the emergence of _Dance Dance Revolution_ (DDR), which revolutionized rhythm gaming by incorporating dance movements as the primary control mechanism. DDR's success led to a proliferation of rhythm games, including titles like _Drummania_ and _Karaoke Revolution_, which expanded the genre's reach into various musical styles and gameplay experiences. This period was characterized by a vibrant creativity among Japanese developers, who produced a wide array of innovative titles that attracted dedicated fanbases.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, American developer Harmonix played a pivotal role in revitalizing the genre with the release of _Guitar Hero_ in 2005 and _Rock Band_ in 2007. These games introduced accessible gameplay that appealed to both gamers and non-gamers, utilizing popular music to enhance their appeal. The success of these franchises marked a peak in the rhythm game boom, generating significant revenue and cultural impact. However, by 2010, the market became saturated with similar titles, leading to a decline in innovation and a hiatus for many major franchises.\n\nSince 2010, rhythm games have adapted to new technologies and trends, including mobile gaming and motion capture. Indie developers have contributed fresh ideas, resulting in unique titles like _Thumper_ and _Sayonara Wild Hearts_. Major franchises such as _Just Dance_ and _Beat Saber_ have continued to thrive, demonstrating the genre's ability to evolve while maintaining its core appeal: the celebration of music and performance. Rhythm games remain a significant cultural force, fostering communal experiences and allowing players to engage with music in interactive and joyful ways."
