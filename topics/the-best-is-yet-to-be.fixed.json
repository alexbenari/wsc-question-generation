  "title": "The Best is Yet to Be, or Not To Be?",
  "material": "In 2009, the Australian government announced an ambitious project to provide super-fast fiber-based Internet to 93% of the population; in 2013, it revised the plan to reuse existing copper wire; in 2025, many Australians still have no (or slow) Internet. First promise big things, then revise the promise to make them little things, then don’t finish them anyway. This isn’t (we hope) a description of the World Scholar’s Cup curriculum release process, but a pattern of behavior for governments all over the world. Discuss with your team: is it better to underpromise and overdeliver, or vice versa? Don’t worry, Australia—you’re not alone. (More on loneliness later.) In Canada, a proposed high-speed rail network had its target speed slashed before being rebranded as a high frequency network. In many developed countries, ambitious projects have gone out of fashion in favor of slow, incremental ones. Check out the mega projects below, as well as those from your own country, then discuss with your team: is this shift in approach justified? How might megaprojects (or their failure) affect the way people perceive progress? And are some countries more consistently successful at these projects? \n\tBig Dig (Boston, USA) – The Central Artery/Tunnel Project, known as the Big Dig, was an enormous urban infrastructure overhaul designed to replace Boston’s elevated highway with an underground expressway and tunnels connecting major parts of the city. Completed in 2007 after years of delays and cost overruns—rising from $2.8 billion to nearly $15 billion—it became a classic example of a megaproject plagued by budget inflation, engineering complexity, and political controversy, though it ultimately transformed Boston’s urban landscape.\n\nChannel Tunnel (UK–France) – Completed in 1994, the Channel Tunnel links the United Kingdom and France beneath the English Channel via a 50-kilometer rail tunnel. Celebrated as an engineering marvel, it enables high-speed passenger and freight transport between London and continental Europe. Despite technical success and symbolic value as a bridge of European unity, the project was marred by massive debt and underestimated demand, illustrating both the promise and pitfalls of transnational infrastructure.\n\nCalifornia High-Speed Rail (USA) – Conceived as America’s first true high-speed train line, connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles, this project began construction in 2015 but remains unfinished. Costs have ballooned from initial projections of $33 billion to over $100 billion, with political opposition, land disputes, and environmental challenges stalling progress. It stands as a cautionary tale about the difficulty of delivering advanced rail systems in the U.S. political and regulatory context.\n\nSejong City (South Korea) – Established in the 2000s as South Korea’s new administrative capital, Sejong City was intended to decentralize government functions from Seoul and promote regional development. Despite state-of-the-art design emphasizing sustainability and smart infrastructure, the relocation of agencies has been partial, and critics argue the city lacks the vibrancy and population density of a true capital. It remains a model of planned urbanism with mixed outcomes.\n\nHambantota (Sri Lanka) – Built with heavy Chinese investment, Hambantota includes a deep-sea port, airport, and industrial zone aimed at transforming Sri Lanka into a logistics hub. However, the project failed to attract expected traffic and revenue, leading to severe debt and eventual leasing of the port to China for 99 years. It has since become a symbol of “debt-trap diplomacy” and the risks of overreliance on foreign-financed megaprojects.\n\nNEOM (Saudi Arabia) – Announced in 2017, NEOM is a futuristic $500-billion megacity planned in northwest Saudi Arabia as part of the country’s Vision 2030 economic diversification strategy. Promising AI-driven urban life, renewable energy, and projects like “The Line”—a 170-kilometer car-free linear city—it aims to attract global investment and innovation. Progress has been slower than planned, and critics question its feasibility and human rights implications.\n\nKhazar Islands (Azerbaijan) – The Khazar Islands project envisions a vast artificial archipelago off Baku’s coast, featuring luxury housing, business districts, and the world’s tallest skyscraper. Proposed in the early 2010s as a symbol of Azerbaijan’s oil wealth and modernity, the $100-billion project has struggled to advance due to financing issues and falling oil revenues, leaving much of it unrealized.\n\nThree Gorges Dam (China) – Completed in 2012, the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is the world’s largest hydroelectric power station, generating enormous amounts of renewable energy and improving flood control. Yet it displaced over a million people and caused significant ecological disruption, sparking debate over the social and environmental costs of such vast engineering feats.\n\nHong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (China) – Opened in 2018, this 55-kilometer bridge-tunnel system links three major cities across the Pearl River Delta, dramatically reducing travel time. Costing around $20 billion, it showcases China’s engineering prowess but faced criticism for its environmental impact, construction delays, and limited initial use relative to cost.\n\nNew Eurasia Land Bridge (Trans-Eurasian Railway) – The New Eurasia Land Bridge is a freight rail corridor connecting China with Europe through Central Asia and Russia. Revitalized under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, it reduces shipping times compared to sea routes and enhances regional trade integration. Despite logistical and political challenges, it represents a cornerstone of China’s global connectivity strategy.\nSometimes social distancing is the problem. In 2023, the World Health Organization declared loneliness a pressing global health threat. Explore how this concern varies around the world, then discuss with your team: do you agree that there is a “loneliness epidemic”—and, if so, how can it be treated?\nSome countries have tried tackling the problem with technology—and none more so than Japan. Explore efforts to “fix” loneliness in Japan and elsewhere, then discuss with your team: are they the sorts of solutions that more societies should adopt? What technologies would you design to achieve the same aims?\nIn 2021, the UN Development Programme found that living conditions in 90% of the world's countries had declined for the second year in a row—possibly contributing to declining birth rates. Discuss with your team: is this decline irreversible or will the world’s population begin to boom again? Should we want it to?\nDuring the Covid pandemic, podcasts exploded in popularity. Their hosts (or at least their subtly-enhanced voices) became many people’s closest friends in a solitary time. Discuss with your team: are podcasts meaningfully different from old-fashioned radio broadcasts in their impact on society, and will their impact continue? In other words, how dated will this bullet seem, ten years from now?)\nSpeaking of bullets, the man who eventually assassinated American President James Garfield, Charles Guiteau, was certain they had a close personal connection (which, of course, Garfield never knew about.) The Internet has driven a surge in these one-sided “parasocial” relationships. Algorithms on these platforms are designed to boost engagement and view time, even if the content is harmful or raises false hopes. Explore how social media also affects the health of adults and seniors, then discuss with your team: who should be held responsible when an algorithm promotes harmful content? Could you design an algorithm to craft a healthier, happier society—and would it be successful?\nHow often do you pick up your phone to check a fact or answer a question during a meal with friends or family? Can you imagine living in a world where things just—stay mysterious, and where you have no idea what is happening a thousand miles away? Researchers have found that the oversaturation of news, especially of negative stories, leads to constant stress and a skewed worldview, especially when they contain violent images and videos. Discuss with your team: to protect people’s mental health, should the government (or others) limit the amount of information we can consume?\n",

	"text": "Australia’s National Broadband Network (NBN) was officially declared “built and fully operational” after more than a decade of development. The project connected roughly 11.86 million premises across the country, though about 35,000 remain unconnected. Despite the milestone, more than 230,000 premises still cannot access the minimum speed of 25 Mbps that the government considers broadband. The NBN began as an ambitious plan to deliver fiber-to-the-premises connections nationwide, promising fast and future-proof internet. However, the original vision was scaled back after political changes, leading to a mixed-technology approach that combined fiber, existing copper lines, hybrid fiber-coax, and wireless links. This compromise helped reduce costs and speed up completion but resulted in slower speeds and uneven quality across regions. While the network is operational, many critics argue that it falls short of global broadband standards and will require major upgrades in the near future. The shift to cheaper technologies has been seen as a short-term fix that leaves Australia lagging behind countries with full fiber infrastructure. The project also faces economic challenges. High wholesale access fees make it difficult for retail internet providers to offer affordable plans, leading to high consumer prices. Questions remain about accountability for service issues and the network’s long-term competitiveness, especially as 5G and other wireless technologies continue to advance."

	"text": "Canada’s dream of high-speed rail remains elusive despite decades of studies, promises, and political rhetoric. The country’s current rail service, operated mainly by Via Rail, remains slow and often delayed—half of its trips in 2023 ran late, and the travel time between Toronto and Montreal is barely faster than driving while costing significantly more. While rail offers comfort and convenience compared to air or road travel, Canada stands alone among G7 nations in lacking a true high-speed network. Over the years, governments have commissioned countless feasibility studies, especially on the Windsor–Quebec City and Calgary–Edmonton corridors, both considered the most viable routes. These studies consistently highlight the potential economic and environmental benefits of high-speed rail, from boosting tourism to cutting emissions. Yet every proposal collapses once costs are revealed—estimates range from $6 to $40 billion, with international examples such as California’s overrun project serving as cautionary tales. The idea frequently reappears during election campaigns but disappears once votes are counted. Structural and geographic realities compound the challenge. Via Rail owns only about 3 percent of the tracks it uses, relying on infrastructure dominated by freight companies like CN Rail that prioritize cargo. This makes true high-speed service nearly impossible. Low population density between Canada’s cities also undermines profitability; the long distances and need to serve multiple communities slow trains and dilute demand. The federal government’s current “high-frequency rail” proposal for the Windsor–Quebec City corridor illustrates a compromise approach. It would add new tracks, electrify trains, and reduce travel times modestly—about one hour between Toronto and Montreal—but still fall short of high-speed standards. While it may improve punctuality and service quality, the project embodies Canada’s cautious pragmatism: a willingness to upgrade, but not to transform. Without stronger public demand or political will, the vision of high-speed rail in Canada remains a dream circling the station rather than departing it."

	"text": "The centerpiece is Bertha, a massive tunnel-boring machine in Seattle that became stuck 120 feet underground early in construction of a city highway tunnel. The machine’s failure triggered cascading complications: tentatively dismissed risks escalated into a costly debacle involving water removal, land subsidence, structural damage to nearby buildings, and extended delays in repair. This Seattle case illustrates what author Jacques Leslie and experts like Bent Flyvbjerg term the “iron law of megaprojects”: they almost invariably run over budget, over time, and below expectations. Many such projects start with wildly optimistic cost and benefit estimates that conceal the real risks. Over time, small problems amplify, and unforeseen events (“black swans”) compound them. Megaprojects also benefit from political and psychological dynamics: bold visions, public appeal, and institutional momentum can drown out cautionary voices. Once a project becomes politically committed and contracts are signed, backing out becomes prohibitively costly — even when evidence mounts against success. Ultimately, Leslie argues that grand scale must not blind decision-makers to simpler, more adaptive alternatives. In Seattle, critics had proposed enhancements to transit, buses, and surface infrastructure instead of tunneling through uncertain ground. The glimmer of a monumental project is seductive—but the risks are often underestimated and consequences profound."

	"text": "megaprojects have evolved from state-driven infrastructure initiatives into strategic tools of globalization and competitiveness. Historically, such projects—like oil and gas facilities, airports, and high-speed railways—were primarily public works designed to deliver national benefits through centralized, technocratic planning. In the contemporary era, however, globalization has reshaped their purpose and scope. Megaprojects now function as instruments for international collaboration, economic modernization, and the expansion of global connectivity, made possible by cross-national partnerships and technological innovation. Cities and nations increasingly view megaprojects as means to enhance their global standing. Faced with the pressures of globalization—expanding markets, sustaining competitiveness, and maintaining institutional and technological relevance—governments invest heavily in urban development, industrial clusters, and large-scale infrastructure. These ventures are costly in financial, social, and environmental terms, yet they are perceived as essential for economic resilience and prestige. The benefits of megaprojects operate on two levels: tangible and intangible. Tangible benefits include measurable economic gains such as increased land values, job creation, and higher tax revenues. Megaprojects are often justified as catalysts for growth, trade, and tourism, particularly in developing countries seeking to attract foreign investment. Intangible benefits, on the other hand, involve cultural and symbolic outcomes—projects that serve as architectural icons or monuments to modernity and national identity. Such projects often aim to broadcast global ambitions and forge distinctive urban identities. Examples include Beijing’s futuristic architecture as a symbol of technological progress, the Oresund Bridge as a landmark of Nordic integration, and Malaysia’s Petronas Towers as emblems of postcolonial pride. Through these examples, the article suggests that megaprojects now function as expressions of both economic aspiration and cultural diplomacy—a way for nations and cities to claim visibility and legitimacy in an interconnected world."

	"text": "The World Health Organization has officially recognized loneliness as a global public health concern that affects people across all ages and geographies. In response, WHO launched the Commission on Social Connection, co-chaired by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and the African Union Youth Envoy Chido Mpemba, to run for three years. Research cited in the announcement suggests loneliness is linked to serious health risks—including higher rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia, and even premature mortality. Some experts estimate the impact on mortality is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The WHO underscores that social isolation and loneliness are underappreciated determinants of mental and physical well-being. The move comes amid rising global concern about disconnection, especially in a world more digitally connected yet socially fragmented. The commission is intended to generate data, policy guidance, and interventions to foster stronger social bonds, reduce isolation, and incorporate social connection into public health strategies globally."

	"text": "Japan faces a rapidly aging population and growing social isolation, especially among the elderly and those living alone. To mitigate these challenges, the country is turning to technological innovations—particularly robots, AI companions, and virtual interaction—to fill emotional and caregiving gaps. Robotic pets (like Sony’s Aibo) and therapeutic robots (such as Paro, the robotic seal) provide companionship, stimulation, and comfort to elders in care facilities. These devices elicit empathy, reduce stress, and help reduce loneliness when human interaction is scarce. Beyond companion robots, more advanced robotic systems are being tested for caregiving tasks—reminding users to take medicine, monitoring health parameters, and even providing basic mobility assistance. Some robots are designed to respond to voice, gestures, and routines, making them more intuitive and embedded in daily life. However, these technologies are not seen as full replacements for human care, but rather as supplements or “extenders” that alleviate burdens on social and healthcare systems. Critics highlight important limitations and risks. Overreliance on machines for emotional interaction may degrade human social skills and reduce incentives to maintain human relationships. Technical challenges—battery life, maintenance, simplistic emotional range—and ethical concerns also temper enthusiasm. The article stresses that while robotics offers partial relief, it cannot substitute for systemic changes—stronger social infrastructure, community networks, and policies supporting human connection must also evolve."

	"text": "Japan has invested heavily over the past two decades in developing robotic and AI systems to help address its intensifying eldercare crisis—driven by a sharply aging population, low birthrates, and a shortage of human caregivers. By 2018 alone, the government had poured over US$300 million into research and development of care robots. Yet despite this investment and considerable hype, adoption has remained modest and problematic. One of the core impediments is that robots often don’t deliver on the promises of reduced labor burden or cost savings. In care facilities that did trial these technologies, staff often found that robots required maintenance, supervision, and integration work—effectively shifting rather than eliminating tasks. Sometimes robots were used briefly before being relegated to closets. Many facilities haven’t adopted them at all; a 2019 survey of over 9,000 Japanese eldercare institutions found only about 10 % had introduced any kind of care robot. Another set of issues involves the social, ethical, and human dimensions of care. Care workers frequently value slower, human-centered interactions—listening, companionship, emotional responsiveness—that machines struggle to replicate. There’s concern that over-reliance on automation could degrade the dignity of care recipients or dehumanize care environments. The article suggests that Japan’s experience cautions against techno-solutionism: robots might assist, but they cannot replace human care or solve systemic challenges in eldercare by themselves."

The global Human Development Index, which measures health, education, and income levels, fell in both 2020 and 2021, effectively erasing five years of progress. This marks an unprecedented setback in human development, reflecting the compounding crises the world has faced in recent years. The decline is attributed to a convergence of global shocks: the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, escalating climate disasters, and rising energy and food prices. These overlapping crises have disrupted health systems, halted education, and destabilized economies, creating what the UN calls an “uncertainty complex” that makes it difficult for nations to recover or plan ahead. The losses are widespread but uneven. Developing regions such as Latin America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean were among the hardest hit, with sharp increases in poverty and inequality. Even wealthier nations saw stagnation in life expectancy and economic resilience. The UN warned that without a renewed focus on cooperation, sustainability, and social protection, recovery will remain fragile. It called for a shift from short-term crisis management toward long-term reforms that build resilience and restore confidence in global progress."

In New South Wales, Australia, for example, a study of low-income residents revealed persistent financial strain across housing, employment, income, and essential expenditures. What was once framed as a passing crisis is increasingly seen as a “new normal.” The author links this prolonged cost pressure to broader systemic forces — what is sometimes called a “meta-crisis” — where financial instability, climate change, and technological disruption intersect and amplify one another. These forces make it difficult to disentangle inflation or rising prices from deeper, structural shifts in the global economy and social systems. Wage growth has frequently lagged inflation, especially in critical sectors like housing, health, and education, shrinking people’s real purchasing power despite nominal increases in income. Simultaneously, supply chain fragilities, higher interest rates, and rising costs in energy and real estate have entrenched pressures that outlast any single policy intervention. In short, the article contends that policymakers and publics should treat the cost of living pressure not as a cyclical disruption to be “fixed” and forgotten, but as a prolonged condition requiring long-term systemic approaches rather than short-term relief measures."

	"text": "The McKinsey Global Institute report “Dependency and Depopulation: Confronting the Consequences of a New Demographic Reality” warns that falling fertility rates are pushing most major economies toward long-term population decline and economic stagnation. Currently, two-thirds of the global population lives in countries where fertility has dropped below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, meaning populations will shrink without migration or rising birth rates. By the end of this century, many advanced economies could lose between 20 and 50 percent of their populations. As populations age, societies are experiencing a dramatic shift in age structures—from youthful pyramids to aging obelisks. In developed nations and China, the working-age share of the population is projected to fall from 67 percent today to 59 percent by 2050. This means fewer workers will be supporting more retirees, creating pressure on welfare systems and threatening the balance between consumption and income. Developing countries, meanwhile, will become the main source of both labor and demand, making their productivity crucial to sustaining global growth. Economic models based on continuous expansion and early retirement are becoming untenable. McKinsey estimates that without significant productivity gains or extended working hours, GDP per capita growth could slow by up to 0.8 percent per year in aging economies. Pension systems may need to divert as much as half of all labor income just to cover senior consumption gaps. To adapt, countries will need to raise fertility rates, reform retirement norms, and harness technology to boost productivity. The report concludes that the world is entering uncharted demographic territory. Without bold policy responses, younger generations will face slower growth, heavier tax burdens, and diminished intergenerational wealth transfers. Reversing or mitigating depopulation will require societal transformation—a recalibration of work, family, and social contracts on a scale without precedent in modern history."

	"text": "In “Tragic but true: how podcasters replaced our real friends,” the author describes how podcasts have come to feel like friendships—especially during the pandemic. Many listeners recognize intimate details about podcasters’ lives—what they ate, what they worry about, even their routines—and feel a personal connection with them. The boundaries between listener and “friend” blur when a voice speaks directly into your headphones, often daily.Podcasts are particularly fertile ground for these parasocial relationships because they are long-form, highly personal, and delivered in a private, one-to-one way. There’s no studio audience to remind you that this is performance, and hosts often share personal stories, jokes, and insights over many episodes. Those evolving narratives create a sense of progression, like you’re following a real relationship unfolding over time. Listeners admit that some podcasts fill emptiness in their social lives. At times, listeners spent more time with podcasters during lockdowns than with real people, and some say they wouldn’t give up their “podcast friendships” even as they reconnect with old friends. These relationships feel comfortable, convenient, and reliable—free of emotional labor or the complications real friendships bring. Yet the piece also notes limits and tensions. Podcasters are performers (even authentic ones) and can’t truly reciprocate. The friendships are one-sided, and listeners must remember that a podcast is mediated content, not a substitute for mutual, messy, authentic human connection. The author plans to continue keeping her podcast pals—but also to reengage with real, unpredictable relationships."

	"text": "The article explores the relationship between social media use and loneliness, noting that while many people feel more connected online, excessive use often correlates with higher levels of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Studies show that heavy users of platforms such as Facebook and Instagram tend to report greater feelings of isolation and lower life satisfaction, particularly when their use is passive rather than interactive. Researchers suggest that the key factor is not the amount of time spent online but how social media is used. Passive scrolling—what psychologists call “social snacking”—creates the illusion of connection without genuine social engagement. It can also fuel unhealthy social comparison, as users constantly measure themselves against the idealized lives others present online. At the same time, the article acknowledges that social media can strengthen relationships when used actively and intentionally—for example, to communicate directly with friends, share meaningful updates, or organize real-world activities. In these cases, online interaction can complement rather than replace in-person connection. Ultimately, the piece argues that social media is neither inherently harmful nor beneficial; its impact depends on self-awareness and moderation. Users who curate their feeds carefully, prioritize genuine exchanges, and balance digital contact with offline relationships are less likely to feel lonely and more likely to experience the positive side of online connectivity."

Algorithms optimize for engagement by amplifying content that commands attention—often emotionally charged, sensational, or polarizing posts. This promotes echo chambers and can worsen anxiety, loneliness, fear of missing out, or depressive symptoms among vulnerable users. Psychiatrists argue that exposure to idealized images and lifestyles online intensifies social comparison and self-criticism. Because algorithms reward posts that generate strong emotional reactions, users can get funneled into content loops that reinforce negative moods. Over time, this can distort perceptions of reality and deepen feelings of inadequacy and isolation. The article also discusses design frameworks and interventions that might curb harm. For example, “safety by design” and “empathic design” approaches would require platforms to incorporate mental-health sensitivity into algorithmic choices (e.g. downranking harmful content, diversifying recommendations). The psychiatrists emphasize that algorithmic interventions should prioritize not only whether a change is “helpful,” but for whom, in what context, and with what trade-offs."

The research suggests this link exists even for older adults, not just young people, a population much less studied in this area. However, the study does not prove causation. It remains unclear whether social media use leads to depression, or if people with depressive tendencies are more likely to engage with social media. The associations might also arise from common personality traits or predispositions that both lead someone to use social media and increase their vulnerability to depression. Interestingly, the data showed age-group differences in which platforms are associated with depressive symptoms. For example, Facebook use correlated with depression in those under 35, whereas in older adults (over 35), usage of TikTok and Snapchat bore stronger associations. The authors emphasize that more research is needed to understand why these patterns differ across age groups. The article proposes that social media may amplify comparison (seeing others’ highlight reels) or promote “doomscrolling,” all of which can depress mood. But it also notes the opportunity: if we understand the mechanisms, perhaps social media could be used to promote healthier behavior and mental health support rather than simply magnify risk."

That immunity, originally conceived for a simpler internet era, fails to account for today’s algorithmic amplification and targeted recommendation systems. The law treats platforms like neutral intermediaries (akin to a bookstore), but in practice they actively shape and influence speech. The article uses the example of Myanmar and the Rohingya genocide to show the real-world consequences. After Facebook became Myanmar’s de facto internet, local actors spread anti-Rohingya hate content. The platform’s algorithms amplified this hateful material and recommended it into vulnerable networks, while content moderation in local languages was severely under-resourced. This combination helped fuel ethnic violence. One central contention is that platforms cannot simply moderate content after the fact; they also must deal proactively with the ways their algorithms surface and prioritize content. The article suggests that relying solely on content moderation is insufficient – algorithmic design, recommendation systems, and contextual sensitivity must also be regulated. In closing, the author contends that platforms should face legal obligations and oversight—especially in sensitive environments. This would include mandating “human rights due diligence,” transparency in algorithmic operations, and accountability for the indirect harms that platforms may enable through design choices rather than direct speech acts."

Media saturation can heighten anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and feelings of helplessness as people struggle to keep up with an unending flow of content. One driving factor is the negative bias of news media: alarming or dystopian content draws attention, and algorithms tend to amplify emotionally charged items—so users end up seeing more of what stresses them. This intensifies the psychological burden rather than helping them stay informed. To cope, the article suggests “media guardrails” such as limiting notifications, setting time boundaries, curating sources (reducing exposure to sensational content), scheduling media-free times, and focusing on high-quality rather than high-quantity consumption. These steps aim to restore balance and reduce emotional wear from perpetual connectivity."

Because news often emphasizes dramatic, negative or unexpected events, it can distort how we view risks and societal trends. Over time, this “negativity bias” in news can influence what we pay attention to, how we judge others, and even how we act. One effect is availability bias: when certain stories are repeatedly covered (e.g. violent crime, pandemics, economic collapse), people tend to overestimate their frequency or personal relevance. That skews risk perception and decision-making. The article notes that even occasional exposure to intense stories can shift moods, raise stress, and influence how one interprets everyday events. News also works as a social cue: by signaling which issues are “important,” it nudges public priorities. For example, when media heavily cover a topic, public concern rises, and political attention often follows. The news thus plays a role in agenda-setting and policy focus, beyond mere reporting. Finally, because people often consume news assortatively (choosing outlets that reinforce their beliefs) and via algorithms, news environments can intensify polarization and echo chambers. The article cautions that to counter these effects one should seek balanced sources, be aware of emotional responses to news, and consciously reflect on what isn’t being covered."

The constant intake of violent, catastrophic, or emotionally charged content activates the same stress systems in our brains as direct trauma, increasing risks for anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and emotional numbness. It explores how digital platforms intensify this exposure: push notifications, 24/7 news cycles, and algorithmic feeds all ensure that users are repeatedly hit with alarming or negative content, often without control. Over time, this “emotional erosion” can desensitize people or make them hypervigilant, reducing their capacity for normal emotional regulation or engagement. The article also notes individual vulnerability factors: prior trauma, low emotional resilience, or limited social support increase the likelihood that someone will suffer negative effects from media overload. In contrast, stronger coping skills, critical media literacy, and social connections can buffer damage. To mitigate harm, the author suggests setting “information boundaries”: limiting media consumption time, curating sources to avoid particularly graphic or sensational coverage, turning off alerts, and scheduling “media sabbaticals.” Mindful, deliberate engagement (vs passive absorption) is key to protecting mental health in an age of relentless information flow."
