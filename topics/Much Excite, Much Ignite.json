And that’s only the start(er): once a car is moving, it speeds away propelled by a series of mini-explosions that keep moving it along until the next traffic jam. With your team, explore the science behind internal combustion engines. How do they work, when were they invented, and are they obsolete? Be sure to consider the following topics: internal combustion engine | heat engine | gas turbine engine | Wankel rotary engine Otto engine | reciprocating piston engine | rotary engines | continuous combustion engines hydrocarbons | diesel | biodiesel | bioethanol | ETBE | hydrogen Long before Elon Musk’s Tesla, electric cars were already popular for their convenience, quietness, and lack of horse manure aroma. Electric cars were poised to dominate the twentieth century—and then they disappeared for a hundred years. With your teammates, explore the invention and spread of early automobiles. (alternate link) What happened to electric cars and what led to their return? What were some of the key innovations in automobiles? Have you ever gotten stuck inside a self-driving taxi? And, most importantly, where are our flying cars? Even the sun is just a gas puddle—but someday that puddle will run dry. While some people worry about whether they will be able to afford a house in their thirties, and others about whether humanity will survive to see the 22nd century, a few very long-term thinkers are already concerned about the sun going dark—and are contemplating whether it could be revived. Read about the fate of the sun, and study how the sun and other stars actually work (for one, they aren’t technically burning), then discuss with your team: when is it worth it to think about problems that are still far in the future? How soon do they need to be expected to happen for them to become urgent considerations? Volcanoes explode, and it’s not baking soda bubbling up inside of them. Explore the science of volcanic eruptions and study their consequences. Review the following cases and research: when and why do dormant volcanoes reawaken, and does human activity play a role? Also, what is an igneous rock?

      "text": "The history of the automobile traces its origins to late 19th-century innovations in Germany and France, where inventors like Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz developed early motor vehicles. The first modern motorcar, the 1901 Mercedes, showcased advanced engineering with a powerful engine and high speed. In contrast, the American market saw the introduction of more affordable models, such as the Oldsmobile, which appealed to middle-class consumers. This divergence in design and pricing set the stage for the automotive industry's evolution, particularly as American manufacturers began to dominate the market.\n\nHenry Ford played a pivotal role in transforming the automotive landscape with the introduction of the Model T in 1908. His innovations in mass production, particularly the moving assembly line, allowed for the efficient manufacture of vehicles at lower costs. The Model T became emblematic of American automotive culture, with its price dropping significantly over its production run, making car ownership accessible to a broader segment of the population. By 1927, over 15 million units had been sold, marking a significant milestone in personal mobility and the concept of \"automobility.\"\n\nThe automotive industry faced challenges as it matured, particularly during the Great Depression, which led to a significant consolidation of manufacturers. The number of active automobile companies dwindled from 253 in 1908 to just 44 by 1929, with Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler emerging as dominant players. This consolidation was driven by the need for substantial capital investment and the adoption of mass production techniques, which favored larger companies over smaller manufacturers. The Model T's decline in popularity also reflected changing consumer preferences as urbanization increased and the demand for more advanced vehicles grew.\n\nPost-World War II, the automotive industry experienced a resurgence, with European and Japanese manufacturers gaining prominence. The shift in global dynamics led to increased competition, prompting American automakers to innovate and adapt. By the 1980s, Japan had established itself as a leading force in the automotive sector, illustrating the industry's transition from a primarily American enterprise to a global marketplace. The automobile's impact on society, economy, and urban development remains profound, shaping transportation and lifestyle in the modern world."

      "text": "The automobile was perfected in late-19th-century Germany and France (Daimler, Benz, Otto, Levassor), but the United States quickly reshaped the industry. Early U.S. makers proliferated, and Henry Ford’s Model T (1908) married workable design to low cost, then mass production and the moving assembly line drove prices down and volumes up. By 1913 the U.S. built most of the world’s cars; by the 1920s Ford, GM, and Chrysler (the “Big Three”) dominated a consolidated domestic market. The central technical-economic challenge—Mercedes-level performance at Oldsmobile-level prices—became, overwhelmingly, an American achievement.\n\nAs demand matured, innovation shifted from breakthroughs to incremental advances, and Alfred P. Sloan’s GM answered market saturation with styling cycles and planned obsolescence, encouraging trade-ins long before mechanical life ended. The Great Depression culled most independents, yet GM remained profitable; World War II then redirected Detroit to massive war production and created pent-up postwar demand. In the 1950s–60s, longer, heavier, gadget-laden “road cruisers” prioritized styling and margin over economy, safety, and quality—contributing to pollution, safety defects, and public backlash that culminated in federal safety, emissions, and fuel-economy standards.\n\nFrom the late 1960s to early 1980s, efficient imports—first Volkswagen, then Japanese small cars—exposed Detroit’s weaknesses. U.S. sales peaked in 1978 before falling sharply; Japan became the top producer by 1980. In response, the Big Three restructured in the 1980s, modernizing plants, adopting quality programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing, aerodynamics, and downsized, safer, cleaner, more fuel-efficient models, lowering break-even volumes in a saturated, global market.\n\nSocially and economically, the automobile transformed 20th-century America: it anchored consumer culture, revolutionized steel and petroleum, spurred tourism and roadside services, reshaped cities and suburbs, ended rural isolation, and justified massive public works like the Interstate Highway System. By 1980, car ownership was nearly universal and most sales were replacements—signs of maturity. The text closes by arguing that the “Automobile Age” has yielded primacy to a new “Age of Electronics,” with future change led more by computing and automation than by cars themselves."

      "name": "key innovations",
      "text": "The article outlines ten significant technological advancements in the automotive industry over the past 75 years, highlighting how these innovations have transformed vehicles into safer, more efficient, and more capable machines. The author notes that while market forces have played a role, government regulations have been pivotal in driving these changes. Many of these technologies first appeared in luxury vehicles before becoming standard in more affordable models, often originating in Europe or Japan before reaching the U.S. market.\n\nKey innovations include fuel injection, which evolved from early mechanical systems to sophisticated electronic versions that improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. Cruise control emerged in the late 1950s, initially for convenience, but gained popularity in the 1970s due to rising fuel prices. Turbochargers, which enhance engine power without significantly increasing fuel consumption, became more reliable in the 1980s, allowing for smaller, more efficient engines. Antilock brakes automated the process of maintaining control during emergency stops, becoming standard by the 21st century.\n\nThe introduction of catalytic converters in the 1970s marked a significant step in reducing vehicle emissions, while computer-controlled engines revolutionized automotive performance and diagnostics. Seat belts and airbags, both mandated by safety regulations, have dramatically improved occupant protection in crashes. The article emphasizes that while seat belts require user compliance, airbags provide passive safety, significantly lowering the risk of fatal injuries when used together.\n\nFinally, advancements in GPS and in-car navigation systems have transformed how drivers navigate, while advanced driver assistance systems aim to mitigate human error, a leading cause of accidents. Although full vehicle automation remains a future goal, the ongoing development of these technologies continues to enhance safety, efficiency, and overall driving experience. The article concludes by reflecting on the profound impact these innovations have had on the automotive landscape, underscoring the importance of continued technological progress."

      "text": "A Los Angeles man’s trip nearly ended in disaster after his **self-driving Waymo taxi malfunctioned**, trapping him as it drove in circles around a parking lot. **Mike Johns**, who was in Scottsdale, Arizona, recorded the bizarre ride on video, later posting it to social media, where it quickly went viral with more than two million views. In the footage, Johns can be heard expressing panic and confusion as the vehicle looped repeatedly. He said neither he nor the Waymo customer service representative—who he wasn’t sure was human or AI—could stop the car.\n\nAfter several minutes, the representative managed to regain control, and the vehicle finally delivered Johns to the airport just in time for his flight to Los Angeles. Although Waymo later explained that the incident lasted a little over five minutes and that Johns wasn’t charged for the trip, the experience left him shaken. He criticized the **“human-less” nature of the interaction**, noting the lack of empathy or accountability from the company and lamenting what he described as a “half-baked product” emblematic of today’s over-automated tech landscape.\n\nJohns, who works in the tech industry himself, said he supports innovation but won’t use Waymo again until he’s confident its safety and customer-service systems are improved. Waymo has since said it identified the problem and fixed it with a **software update**, adding that it attempted to contact Johns afterward.\n\nThe glitch came at an already tense moment for the company: just days earlier, Waymo made headlines when a person in downtown Los Angeles allegedly tried to **hijack one of its autonomous Jaguar vehicles**. Together, the incidents have amplified public scrutiny of self-driving technology’s reliability and the uneasy role of artificial intelligence in everyday transportation."

      "name": "flying cars",
      "text": "The concept of flying cars, long relegated to the realm of science fiction, is on the verge of becoming a reality due to advancements in technology. Experts, including aerospace engineer Xiaosong Du, assert that the necessary technology already exists, with prototypes of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles being tested. These vehicles are envisioned as hybrids between airplanes and helicopters, capable of taking off vertically and transitioning to horizontal flight, thereby combining the benefits of both modes of transportation.\n\nHistorically, the idea of flying cars has been explored for over a century, with some early attempts, such as the Convair Model 118 ConvAirCar in 1947, ultimately failing. Current developments, however, are more promising, with companies like Alef Aeronautics planning to produce vehicles that can operate both on roads and in the air. These vehicles are expected to come with high price tags, around $300,000, which may limit their accessibility. As a more feasible alternative, the emergence of flying rideshare services, akin to Uber or Lyft, is anticipated within the next couple of decades.\n\nDespite the technological advancements, several challenges remain before flying cars can become commonplace. Safety regulations and extensive testing are crucial, with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently announcing new rules for air taxis. Additionally, the current battery technology poses limitations, as existing lithium-ion batteries can only support flight for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. This raises concerns about the feasibility of flying cars, as a loss of power during flight could lead to catastrophic failures.\n\nResearchers are actively working to enhance battery efficiency and address these challenges. The future of flying cars hinges not only on technological innovation but also on regulatory frameworks and public acceptance. As the industry progresses, the dream of personal aerial transportation may soon transition from fiction to reality, reshaping urban mobility and transportation paradigms."

      "text": "The article explores the potential methods for prolonging the lifespan of the Sun, which is expected to exhaust its hydrogen fuel in about a billion years and eventually transform into a red giant before becoming a white dwarf. This transformation poses existential threats to Earth, potentially leading to the extinction of life. The author discusses the implications of the Sun's life cycle, emphasizing the urgency of finding solutions to extend its viability, especially if Earth is the only known harbor of life in the universe.\n\nOne proposed method is to increase the Sun's fuel supply by adding mass, specifically by introducing the gas giants of the solar system into the Sun. However, this approach would inadvertently increase the Sun's gravitational pressure, causing it to burn hotter and ultimately shorten its lifespan by approximately 30 million years. Conversely, the article suggests that removing mass from the Sun could theoretically extend its life. By reducing the Sun's mass to a fraction of its current size, it could mimic the longevity of red dwarf stars, which can last trillions of years. However, this would necessitate relocating Earth closer to the Sun, risking tidal locking and exposing the planet to hazardous solar flares.\n\nAnother intriguing idea involves reversing the fusion process by splitting helium back into hydrogen, which could allow the Sun to sustain its fusion indefinitely. Despite its theoretical appeal, this method faces significant challenges, primarily due to the energy requirements of such a process being greater than the energy produced by the Sun's natural fusion. Even with advanced technologies, this approach could only extend the Sun's life to about a trillion years, rather than achieving true immortality.\n\nIn conclusion, while various methods to prolong the Sun's life are theoretically conceivable, their practicality and feasibility remain questionable. The author posits that humanity's future may hinge on either developing these technologies or finding ways to adapt to interstellar travel. Ultimately, the pursuit of extending the Sun's lifespan reflects a broader desire to preserve life on Earth and explore the cosmos, underscoring the importance of innovation and resilience in the face of cosmic challenges."

      "name": "fate of the sun",
      "text": "Our Sun will spend another 5–7 billion years fusing hydrogen to helium, gradually brightening as helium builds up in its core. When core hydrogen is exhausted, the Sun will swell into a red giant, certainly engulfing Mercury and Venus and possibly Earth, before igniting helium fusion to make carbon and oxygen. Near the end of this phase, it will shed its outer layers as a glowing planetary nebula.\n\nWhat remains will be a compact, Earth-sized white dwarf composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, about half the Sun’s current mass. Adiabatic compression makes young white dwarfs extremely hot (~20,000 K), but with only a small surface area to radiate from they cool extraordinarily slowly. Over ~10¹⁴–10¹⁵ years, the remnant will fade beyond visibility and become a near–absolute-zero “black dwarf.”\n\nThat isn’t necessarily the final act. If the remnant later acquires fresh fuel—by merging with a small star or brown dwarf, sweeping up hydrogen from a cloud or rogue gas giant, or colliding with another stellar corpse—it could briefly reignite (a nova) or, in a white-dwarf merger, even detonate as a Type Ia supernova. Absent such luck, countless weak gravitational nudges will likely eject the Sun’s black dwarf from our merged Local Group remnant after ~10¹⁷–10¹⁹ years.\n\nIn short: Sun-like stars don’t explode as core-collapse supernovae; they end as white dwarfs that cool to black dwarfs over immense timescales. The most probable long-term fate of our Sun is a quiet fade to darkness and eventual exile from its galactic home, with rare but not impossible detours involving renewed outbursts—or a final rendezvous with a black hole."

      "text": "The Sun, classified as a yellow dwarf star, is the central body of our solar system, containing over 98% of its total mass. This immense mass generates a strong gravitational pull that keeps Earth and other celestial bodies in orbit. The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (92.1%) and helium (7.9%), with trace amounts of other elements. It produces energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. This energy is essential for life on Earth, as it warms the planet and drives various ecological processes.\n\nStructurally, the Sun consists of three main regions: the interior, the visible surface, and the atmosphere. The interior is further divided into the core, radiative zone, and convective zone, where energy is generated and transported to the surface. The visible surface, known as the photosphere, is not solid and cannot be stood upon. Above the photosphere lies the Sun's atmosphere, which includes the chromosphere and the corona. The corona, visible during a solar eclipse, emits solar wind—a stream of charged particles that extends far into space, influencing the solar system's dynamics.\n\nThe Sun continuously emits vast amounts of energy, approximately 3.8 x 10^26 terawatts per second, with light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation being the primary outputs. Despite the relative constancy of this emission, small fluctuations can significantly impact Earth, leading to phenomena such as solar storms. These storms can disrupt communication and navigation systems and create auroras in the Earth's atmosphere through interactions with charged particles.\n\nEnergy generation in the Sun is a complex process that begins with nuclear fusion in the core, where hydrogen protons collide and fuse to form helium, producing gamma rays. This energy gradually moves outward over tens of thousands of years, ultimately reaching the surface and being released into space as electromagnetic radiation. The Sun's energy production and its effects on the solar system underscore its critical role in sustaining life and influencing environmental conditions on Earth."
