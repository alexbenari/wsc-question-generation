Will the future be built from bits of the past, or from materials we haven’t even imagined yet? What would you prefer to see? Listen to the song “Section 52 (Morning Sun, I Built the Stairs)” by the Polyphonic Spree, and then consider whether it feels more like a song about beginnings, endings, or starting over again. Is it optimistic about what comes next? Are you? Work with your team to imagine yourselves reuniting in 20 years; you can even use AI tools online to create images of what you’ll like in the future. What kind of world will you be living in, and what sorts of people will you become? Which of your dreams, if any, do you think will need reigniting?",

      "text": "David Irvine, a Toronto-based artist, has gained recognition for his innovative approach to art through the practice of \"upcycling\" thrift store paintings. His work involves repurposing old prints, which he finds nostalgic and appealing due to their vintage frames. Initially, Irvine would paint over these canvases, but he later began to incorporate pop culture figures into the original artworks, creating a juxtaposition between traditional scenes and contemporary icons. Over five years, he has transformed hundreds of paintings, often inspired by spontaneous ideas that come to him while viewing the original pieces.\n\nIrvine's artistic process is characterized by a playful blend of humor and nostalgia. He often integrates well-known characters, such as Darth Vader and Pac-Man, into serene landscapes or classic portraits, which he describes as a way to make the old feel new again. His works are not merely alterations but rather thoughtful additions that provoke a dialogue between the past and present. Irvine emphasizes the importance of maintaining the original style and color palette of the paintings to ensure that his contributions feel cohesive rather than disjointed.\n\nThe artist's choice to work primarily with prints and lithographs stems from a respect for original artworks, which he prefers not to alter. This decision reflects a broader commentary on the value of art and the stories embedded within these thrifted pieces. By upcycling, Irvine not only breathes new life into forgotten artworks but also invites viewers to reconsider their perceptions of value and creativity in art.\n\nIrvine's work resonates with audiences due to its relatable themes and humor, often drawing connections to shared cultural experiences. His unique approach to combining the old with the new has garnered attention, highlighting the potential for creativity in the realm of upcycling and the importance of sustainability in art. Through his paintings, Irvine encourages a reflection on nostalgia, pop culture, and the evolving nature of artistic expression."
