  "material": "Entertaining Ourselves Back to Life The third book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is titled The Return of the King; in it (spoilers ahead) the character Aragorn returns to unite humanity against a dire threat. The idea of a prophesied king reappearing and bringing his people together again against a formidable foe is common in literary history, from the overtold legend of King Arthur to the incomplete story of Jon Snow. Explore some of the following legends, then discuss with your team: why do such stories have such appeal? What political developments in today’s world might have similar causes? Horus | Yudhishthira | Jesus | Richard the Lionheart Charles II | Louis XVIII | Henry VII | Juan Carlos I The Hobbit | Prince Caspian | Kimba the White Lion When at first you don’t succeed, try and try again—and, likely as not, flop harder. Napoleon Bonaparte returned from exile in Elba as a self-reproclaimed emperor, only to drown in misfortune at Waterloo. Look into the following figures whose careers took off post-exile, then discuss with your team: why was their second wind better than their first? Can you think of other examples of individuals, like Napoleon, who attempted a comeback—but failed spectacularly? Albert Einstein | Leon Trotsky | Jimmy Carter | Friedrich Engels Dante | Confucius | Rodrigo Belmonte Malala Yousafzai | Sun Mu | Belarus Free Theatre | An-My Le “Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'” quipped the 2010 hit song “If I Die Young”. Consider the other now-famous dead people below and discuss with your team: what is the best way to reignite someone’s legacy? Vincent van Gogh, for instance, only became famous after his death thanks to the people in his life. Should we focus more on studying the works of those who are still alive, or does a creator’s death make their creations more interesting in some way? Gregor Mendel | Alfred Wegener Emily Dickinson | Franz Kafka | Anne Frank Vivian Maier | Otis Redding | Jim Croce | Nick Drake “I did it again” isn’t always an oops; it’s often a plan. Many artists re-record and sometimes greatly revise and recreate their own past works. Taylor Swift’s new “Version(s)” of her old albums have set the charts on fire even though most of her songs are little-changed—but for some, her success has had consequences. Discuss with your team: what is the right time to re-release existing works, and to what degree should the original creator need to be involved? In 2023, electronic music artist Porter Robinson created the “Po-uta” voice bank to allow future artists to create songs using his voice. Check out this interview where he explains his motivations as well as the demonstration song “Humansongs”. Similarly, some Hollywood actors are creating digital clones of themselves with the help of AI—some to preserve their likeness for the future, others to accept multiple gigs at once. Explore these technologies with your team, then discuss with your team: when (and how much) does it matter whether an artwork is created by the artist themselves or their digital clone? For years, people have wondered what Beethoven’s tenth symphony—the “Unfinished”—would have sounded like if he had lived a little bit longer. Now, an AI has taken on the task, with substantial human involvement. Read about the effort, then compare the outcome to this earlier attempt by the composer Barry Cooper. Which seems more authentic to you—and which has more artistic value? Are there other unfinished works you would like to see completed in a similar way? Some people think a lot about the Roman Empire, but the songwriter Jorge Rivera-Herrans was more into ancient Greece. Explore the TikTok-documented story behind the creation of his EPIC: The Musical—which was inspired by Homer’s The Odyssey but blends modern genres, even video game music, and listen to at least this one example song (you’ll probably want to keep going): “Wouldn’t You Like”. Afterward, discuss with your team: should more creators communicate openly with the public while developing new works of fiction, theater, and art? Should we have done that with these outlines?",

      "text": "Taylor Swift's re-recording project, initiated in 2019 after her original master recordings were sold without her consent, has significantly impacted the music industry and prompted record labels to reconsider their contractual practices. Swift's objective was to reclaim ownership of her music and diminish the value of the original recordings. Her re-recorded albums have not only outperformed the originals but have also propelled her to unprecedented levels of success, including becoming a billionaire in 2023. This success has led major record labels to impose stricter re-recording restrictions on new artists, requiring them to wait significantly longer—up to thirty years—before they can re-record their music.\n\nThe article outlines the complexities of copyright law as it pertains to master recordings and the traditional dynamics between artists and record labels. Under U.S. copyright law, record labels typically own the rights to master recordings, which creates a power imbalance favoring the labels. Swift's journey illustrates this dynamic, as her initial contract with Big Machine Records granted the label ownership of her first six albums. After leaving Big Machine and signing with Republic Records, Swift regained ownership of her future master recordings, allowing her to pursue her re-recording project without violating copyright laws.\n\nSwift's re-recording strategy has not only been commercially successful but has also served as a catalyst for broader discussions about artists' rights and ownership in the music industry. The article notes that while re-recording is not a new concept, Swift's success has brought renewed attention to the issue, influencing how new artists negotiate their contracts. For instance, artists like Olivia Rodrigo have sought to retain control over their master recordings, inspired by Swift's experiences. This shift indicates a growing awareness among artists regarding their rights and the importance of negotiating favorable terms in their contracts.\n\nIn light of these developments, the article argues that record labels should adopt a more collaborative approach with artists rather than imposing lengthy re-recording restrictions. The changing landscape of the music industry, particularly with the rise of digital platforms, has diminished artists' reliance on labels for success. By treating artists as partners and fostering mutually beneficial relationships, labels could adapt to the evolving industry dynamics and support artists in achieving their creative and commercial goals."

      "text": "In a recent interview, Porter Robinson discusses his experience with the VOCALOID voice bank \"Po-uta,\" which he created using his own voice. Robinson expresses excitement about this opportunity, noting that VOCALOID music significantly influenced his album _Nurture_. He highlights the impact of Japanese artists like DECO*27 and KZ/Livetune on his musical style, particularly their use of melancholic chord progressions. The process of using the voice bank inspired him to approach music creation differently, focusing on syllables and meanings in a more integrated manner than his usual method of starting with auto-tuned vocals.\n\nRobinson elaborates on the thematic elements of the demo song featuring Po-uta, which explores the relationship between an artificial mind and its creator. He aims to evoke feelings of grief and contemplation regarding the ethical dilemmas posed by AI, framing the narrative as a child mourning a parent. This emotional lens, while not necessarily realistic, is intended to resonate with human experiences, emphasizing the artistic intent behind the work.\n\nReflecting on his journey with VOCALOID, Robinson recounts his early encounters with the technology, particularly through the character Hatsune Miku and the English VOCALOID Avanna. He acknowledges the significance of these experiences in shaping his music, particularly in his 2014 album _Worlds_, where he sought to capture the unique emotional qualities of digital voices. He appreciates the power of vocals in music, noting their ability to convey both melody and meaning, and views VOCALOID as a natural evolution of voice manipulation technologies.\n\nLooking ahead, Robinson expresses optimism about the future of VOCALOID, anticipating advancements that will enhance its flexibility and realism. He hopes that creators will embrace Po-uta's unique voice and produce original works that explore its character. Ultimately, he encourages artists to use available tools to express their innermost ideas, emphasizing the importance of creativity in the face of technological evolution."

      "text": "Heather Tal Murphy’s *Slate* article **“Actors Are Already Selling Digital Clones of Themselves for $500. Are Stars Next?”** examines how **AI-driven digital doubles** are already transforming entertainment and labor — and why the technology’s rise has Hollywood unions and performers on edge. The piece blends firsthand accounts, emerging industry trends, and ethical concerns to show that what once seemed like a sci-fi scenario has already entered the marketplace.\n\nIt begins with the story of **Devin Finley**, a New York voice actor who allowed a company called **Hour One** to create and license his virtual replica for $500. Using a short filming session and AI modeling, the company produced a lifelike avatar that can appear in corporate videos or ads—speaking multiple languages, never aging, and continuing to “work” indefinitely. Finley found the idea both unsettling and liberating: a way to earn money passively, but also to surrender control over his likeness. Companies such as **Hour One** and **Synthesia** now produce thousands of such “virtual human” videos for corporate clients, signaling a fast-expanding industry that sits outside traditional union protections.\n\nMurphy then situates this phenomenon within a broader **Hollywood labor crisis**. As studios explore AI’s potential to recreate or simulate performers’ likenesses, unions like **SAG-AFTRA** are pushing to define clear rules on consent, compensation, and usage limits. The issue loomed large during the 2023–2024 writers’ and actors’ strikes, reflecting wider anxieties about automation and creative control. Startups such as **Runway** and **Brask Doubles** already offer tools to generate video content from text or swap celebrity faces onto body doubles, often used in advertising when stars like Lionel Messi or Kylian Mbappé can’t be present. These technologies reduce production costs and timelines—making synthetic likenesses a tempting shortcut for studios and brands.\n\nThe article breaks down several **concrete uses** of AI cloning already in play:\n\n* **Advertising stand-ins**, where brands use AI-masked doubles of celebrities.\n* **“Synthespians”**, digital overlays that rely on real body doubles but use AI for the face or voice.\n* **Advanced dubbing**, in which AI adjusts lip movements to match new languages.\n* **Corporate avatars**, used in marketing, training, and instructional videos—cheap, controllable, and endlessly reusable.\n\nMurphy concludes that while today’s technology still depends on human stand-ins for realism, the **erosion of performer control** is already underway. Licensing one’s digital twin may soon become as routine as signing a brand deal, but with deeper implications: once an avatar exists, it can speak, move, and act without its human’s consent or oversight. The looming question, she writes, is not whether AI clones will reshape entertainment—but **who will own and profit from the human image in the age of synthetic identity.**"

      "text": "The YouTube video titled \"Symphony No.10 in E-flat major - Ludwig van Beethoven / Barry Cooper\" features a performance by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Wyn Morris. This symphony, which Beethoven began composing before completing his Ninth Symphony, remains largely unfinished. The work on Symphony No. 10 began in earnest around 1822 and continued until Beethoven's death in 1827, but only the first movement was developed in detail. The sketches for the symphony are fragmented and scattered across various manuscripts, making it challenging to ascertain Beethoven's complete intentions for the piece.\n\nBarry Cooper, a musicologist with a focus on Beethoven's works, undertook the task of reconstructing the first movement based on the available sketches. He identified over 50 sketches, which, while incomplete, provided substantial thematic material. Cooper's approach involved filling in gaps and orchestrating the movement in a style consistent with Beethoven's known works. The reconstruction process revealed around 250 bars of sketches, although many were repetitive or contradictory, leading to the use of thematic material in various ways to create a coherent performance version.\n\nThe resulting performance aims to offer a glimpse into what Beethoven might have envisioned for his Tenth Symphony. While Cooper's completion is not a definitive representation of Beethoven's intentions, it provides a valuable interpretation that allows audiences to experience the music in a way that the original sketches alone could not convey. The performance is characterized by its adherence to Beethoven's stylistic elements, though it may reflect more of his middle period rather than the late style typically associated with his later works.\n\nOverall, the video serves as both a musical performance and an exploration of Beethoven's creative process, highlighting the challenges and possibilities inherent in reconstructing unfinished compositions. It invites listeners to engage with Beethoven's legacy and consider the implications of his incomplete works within the broader context of classical music history."

Rivera-Herrans' musical focuses on Odysseus' tumultuous journey home to his wife and son, exploring themes of morality and the supernatural, while aiming to bring renewed attention to \"The Odyssey,\" which often gets overshadowed by \"The Iliad.\"\n\nThe project began as a passion project in 2019, evolving from Rivera-Herrans' college dorm room. Influenced by music and storytelling from video games and anime, he began sharing snippets of the musical on TikTok in early 2021, engaging his audience with insights into his creative process. By March 2022, he presented a seminar at the Goodspeed Festival of New Musicals, announcing that the musical would be released in chapters, or \"sagas.\" The first saga, \"The Troy Saga,\" was released in December 2022, with a total of nine sagas planned, seven of which have been released to date.\n\nThe musical has cultivated a growing fanbase, uniting diverse online communities of animators, actors, musicians, and writers. Rivera-Herrans emphasizes the importance of enjoyment and collaboration among the cast and crew, which is evident in the playful behind-the-scenes content shared on social media. This sense of camaraderie contributes to the musical's appeal, fostering a vibrant community around the project.\n\nMusically, \"Epic\" is described as a hauntingly brilliant work that intricately weaves together themes from its source material, maintaining fidelity to the essence of \"The Odyssey.\" It does not shy away from the darker elements of the original text, instead highlighting the supernatural aspects that are central to the narrative. The latest saga, \"The Wisdom Saga,\" introduces Telemachus, Odysseus's son, and further explores the kingdom of Ithaca. While currently available only as a concept album, the potential for a staged performance remains a point of anticipation for fans."
