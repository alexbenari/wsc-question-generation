  "material": "Introductory Questions Rip Van Winkle slept for twenty years, Steve Rogers for seventy, Aang for a hundred—in each case, with remarkably little impact on their health. (Rip Van Winke did grow some facial hair.) Imagine that you went through something similar and woke up in the year 2120 (albeit with neither superpowers nor supercharged follicles.) How quickly do you think you’d notice you were in the future? Would beds feel different? Would chairs be strange shapes? Would there be funky new food in the fridge? Would there still be a Global Round in Bangkok? Outside your home, would you encounter a strange new society or one roughly like our own? Or would you encounter no society at all, just a picturesque (and probably terrifying) post-apocalyptic landscape? “Slice of life” is more than a film genre: research everyday life in the years 1825 and 1925 to learn more about how much things changed between those two years and between 1925 and now. Has the rate of change in your community slowed down or sped up–or does it depend on what you’re looking at? A hundred years is a long time. What if the same thing happened, but you woke up (like Rip Van Winkle!) only 20 years in the future? What do you imagine the year 2045 will be like for students like you? What are the easiest things to predict–and what are the hardest? Some things catch fire literally, others metaphorically—and the fires that most interest us are those happening for at least the second time. Without reading the rest of this outline, brainstorm with your friends what it could mean for something to re-ignite, and how different that is than igniting in the first place. When is it better for something to burn twice? And is there a difference between burning up, burning down, and burning with? There’s no denying that some things excite our passions. For some of you, maybe, World Scholar’s Cup is that kind of cause; others of you might thrill to the fight against global climate change, a big boss in the Forgotten Land, or the harmful impacts of social media. But what would it take to have your feelings about something (or somewhere or someone) re-ignited? Under what circumstances does a person leave a project, then return to it with new zeal? Not long ago, the future beckoned with open arms. Many people at the beginning of the 20th century–and even at its conclusion!–were certain that social and technological progress would continue endlessly, that there was a kind of Moore’s Law for everything. (At least one influential thinker still believes this.) Consider the musical selection “Counting Up to Twenty” as just one example of this boundless optimism. In those not-so-long-ago times, forecasts for the future were exuberant—and sometimes even exuberantly dull. How do you see the future, and how does your view compare to that of the older people in your life? “The best is yet to be,” wrote the English poet Robert Browning, a phrase often quoted (out of context) to evoke a sense of possibility and hope. But we now live, many people are saying, in a pessimistic age–in which some people even avoid having children to protect them from the grim days ahead. If you met someone who was sure the future would be full of suffering, would you try to give them hope again? If so, what would you tell them? Take a step back from the broader future to zoom in on small things that can also be recalled to life with new vitality: musical bands, TV shows, even products once abandoned to museums and overstock warehouses. (For instance, walk around your school and may spot someone buzzing about with a film camera.) We’ll investigate them more later in this outline, but, for now, what other dead or derelict institutions, products, or trends do you think will become popular again in our lifetimes? Is there a restaurant that you and your family miss that you wish would be revived—and how much effort would you be willing to put into that revival? While actual resurrection is probably still impossible, individuals can still be recalled to life in different ways, as in this first book of A Tale of Two Cities–whether it is after incarceration, illness, or a different kind of darkness. Do you know anyone who has found a new lease on life in this way? How can we best support someone who is starting over again?",

      "text": "Sam Altman's essay, \"Moore's Law for Everything,\" posits that society is on the brink of a fourth technological revolution driven by artificial intelligence (AI), which he believes will lead to unprecedented advancements over the next century. Altman draws parallels to Moore's Law, suggesting that AI will enable a future where the cost of goods and services decreases by 50% every two years. This transformation is expected to democratize access to resources and opportunities that were previously expensive or unattainable.\n\nThe essay is structured into five main sections. In the first, Altman outlines the AI revolution as a pivotal moment in human history, asserting that the next hundred years will yield more progress than all previous eras combined. The second section elaborates on the implications of this technological shift, emphasizing the potential for widespread economic benefits. The third section critiques the current taxation system, arguing that taxing income will become less relevant as AI reshapes labor dynamics. Instead, he proposes a national equity fund funded by taxes on capital and land, which would distribute wealth to citizens, thereby aligning their interests with national prosperity.\n\nIn the fourth section, Altman provides a rough estimate of the financial impact of his proposal, suggesting that citizens could receive $13,500 annually from the equity fund within a decade, significantly enhancing their purchasing power. He acknowledges potential challenges in implementing this system and offers strategies for addressing them. The final section advocates for a gradual transition to this new economic model, linking tax increases to GDP growth to mitigate potential shocks to the economy.\n\nWhile the essay presents an optimistic vision of the future, it has been met with mixed reactions. Critics note that Altman could have provided more concrete examples of how AI will tangibly improve lives, as his discussion often leans towards abstract concepts. Additionally, concerns arise regarding the feasibility of his proposals, particularly in balancing the effects of decreased labor costs with the potential for increased unemployment. Altman frames his ideas as a starting point for discussion, acknowledging the complexities involved in navigating the future of AI and its societal implications."

      "text": "The article discusses political commentator Ezra Klein’s analysis of Donald Trump’s communication style, particularly his habit of saying, “many people are saying.” Klein argues that Trump’s rhetoric is less a symptom of aging or cognitive decline, as critics claim, and more a reflection of his long-standing personality—marked by impulsivity, low conscientiousness, and lack of behavioral inhibition. Rather than being constrained by the social filters most people apply, Trump speaks without restraint, which Klein suggests is both his strength and his flaw.\n\nKlein contends that Trump’s trademark phrase, “many people are saying,” serves as a rhetorical device to project private thoughts into the public sphere. Instead of reporting what others say, Trump voices what many think but are unwilling to express openly. Klein traces this tendency back to Trump’s 2016 campaign, citing moments such as his criticism of the Iraq War—comments that resonated with parts of the Republican base who felt establishment figures were too cautious or constrained.\n\nThis candor, according to Klein, helped Trump capture public and political attention by articulating unspoken frustrations about immigration, trade, and foreign policy. However, it also exposes a deeper limitation: Trump’s inability to self-censor or consider the broader consequences of his statements. Klein argues that Trump does not take advice, reflect on past errors, or adjust his positions—traits that prevent the development of wisdom and strategic foresight.\n\nKlein concludes that Trump’s unfiltered approach has defined his career but also limits his capacity to evolve. His platform, nearly unchanged since 2016, reflects a refusal to learn or adapt. Critics such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz frame this rigidity as evidence of decline, but Klein views it instead as a continuation of Trump’s consistent, unrestrained mode of expression—one that mirrors both his enduring appeal and his enduring shortcomings."

      "text": "The article \"Against Doomerism\" addresses the pervasive pessimism surrounding global issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, and food security. It highlights a significant trend among younger generations, with many expressing a belief that \"humanity is doomed.\" This sense of despair is attributed to the chaotic and often negative portrayal of current events in media. However, the article argues that this perspective overlooks the substantial progress humanity has made over the past centuries, particularly in areas like poverty reduction and public health.\n\nThe author, Bryan Walsh, emphasizes the importance of \"changeable optimism,\" a concept that encourages a realistic yet hopeful view of the future. This approach acknowledges the challenges we face while also recognizing the potential for positive change through collective action and innovation. The article suggests that fostering a sense of optimism is crucial for motivating individuals and societies to work towards solutions rather than succumbing to fatalism.\n\nWalsh points out that while the problems we face are significant, they are not insurmountable. Historical evidence shows that humanity has successfully navigated crises before, and there are numerous examples of technological and social advancements that can lead to a better future. The article calls for a shift in narrative from one of doom to one that highlights possibilities and encourages proactive engagement with the world's challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Against Doomerism\" advocates for a balanced perspective that combines awareness of current issues with a hopeful outlook on the future. By embracing a mindset of optimism grounded in realism, individuals and communities can be inspired to take meaningful action, ultimately shaping a future that is not only survivable but also thriving."

      "text": "The article explores the personal decisions of climate scientists regarding childbearing in the context of ongoing environmental crises. Many scientists express deep concern about the future of the planet, leading some to reconsider their choices about having children. Camille Parmesan, a prominent climate scientist, reflects on her decision not to have children, citing the dire state of the world and the emotional burden of bringing a child into such circumstances. A survey conducted by the Guardian revealed that nearly 20% of female climate experts have opted for fewer or no children due to environmental concerns, highlighting the emotional and ethical complexities surrounding this issue.\n\nShobha Maharaj, another climate scientist, shares her struggle with the decision to have only one child, driven by fears about the future and the environmental impact of adding another person to the planet. The article emphasizes the psychological toll that climate change has on these scientists, many of whom feel a sense of impending loss and responsibility for the world they would be leaving to their children. The survey included responses from 360 scientists, revealing that while a minority of male scientists also reported having fewer children, the majority of decisions were made by women, often reflecting a long-standing awareness of the environmental implications of population growth.\n\nThe article also touches on the broader debate regarding population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation. Some scientists argue that the focus should not solely be on the number of people but also on consumption patterns and the environmental impact of affluent lifestyles. The discussion is complicated by historical controversies surrounding population control, particularly in developing countries, where the implications of such policies have raised ethical concerns. The scientists interviewed advocate for better education and access to reproductive health resources as more humane solutions to population-related environmental issues.\n\nUltimately, the article illustrates the profound impact of climate change on personal life choices among scientists who are acutely aware of the challenges facing future generations. Their decisions reflect a blend of personal values, professional insights, and a desire to contribute positively to the world, even as they grapple with the uncertainties of an increasingly precarious future."

      "name": "first book",
      "text": "In the opening chapter of \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" titled \"The Period,\" Charles Dickens sets the stage for the tumultuous events of the late 18th century, particularly the years leading up to the French Revolution. The chapter famously begins with a series of contrasting statements that encapsulate the dualities of the era: it was both the best and worst of times, characterized by wisdom and foolishness, belief and incredulity. This juxtaposition serves to highlight the complexity of the historical moment, suggesting that the period was marked by both hope and despair.\n\nDickens introduces the political landscape of England and France, describing the rulers of both nations—an English king and queen, and their French counterparts—who appear oblivious to the brewing discontent among their subjects. The narrative references significant events and figures, such as Mrs. Southcott, a prophetic figure in England, and the Cock-lane ghost, which symbolize the era's fascination with spiritualism and the supernatural. The mention of the American colonies' burgeoning independence hints at the shifting dynamics of power and the emerging revolutionary spirit that would soon engulf France.\n\nThe chapter also paints a grim picture of societal conditions, particularly in France, where brutal punishments are meted out for minor offenses, reflecting a harsh and oppressive regime. Dickens foreshadows the violence of the Revolution with imagery of the \"Woodman, Fate,\" and the \"Farmer, Death,\" suggesting that the seeds of upheaval are being sown quietly yet inexorably. The narrative implies that the societal injustices and the indifference of the ruling classes will lead to inevitable consequences.\n\nOverall, \"The Period\" serves as a powerful introduction to the themes of resurrection, sacrifice, and social justice that permeate the novel. Dickens's vivid portrayal of the contrasting realities of the time sets the tone for the unfolding drama, inviting readers to reflect on the cyclical nature of history and the potential for change amidst chaos. The chapter establishes a foundation for understanding the characters and events that will emerge as the story progresses, emphasizing the interconnectedness of individual lives and broader historical forces."
