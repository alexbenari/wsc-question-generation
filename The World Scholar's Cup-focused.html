			<li>Rip Van Winkle slept for twenty years, Steve Rogers for seventy, Aang for a hundred—in each case, with remarkably little impact on their health. (Rip Van Winke did grow some facial hair.) Imagine that you went through something similar and woke up in the year 2120 (albeit with neither superpowers nor supercharged follicles.) How quickly do you think you’d notice you were in the future? Would beds feel different? Would chairs be strange shapes? Would there be funky new food in the fridge? Would there still be a Global Round in Bangkok? Outside your home, would you encounter a strange new society or one roughly like our own? Or would you encounter no society at all, just a picturesque (and probably terrifying) post-apocalyptic landscape?</li>
	
			<li>“Slice of life” is more than a film genre: research everyday life in the years 1825 and 1925 to learn more about how much things changed between those two years and between 1925 and now. Has the rate of change in your community slowed down or sped up–or does it depend on what you’re looking at?</li>
	
			<li>A hundred years is a long time. What if the same thing happened, but you woke up (like Rip Van Winkle!) only 20 years in the future? What do you imagine the year 2045 will be like for students like you? What are the easiest things to predict–and what are the hardest?</li>
	
			<li>Some things catch fire literally, others metaphorically—and the fires that most interest us are those happening for at least the second time. Without reading the rest of this outline, brainstorm with your friends what it could mean for something to <i>re</i>-ignite, and how different that is than igniting in the first place. When is it better for something to burn twice? And is there a difference between burning <i>up</i>, burning <i>down</i>, and burning <i>with</i>?</li>
	
			<li>There’s no denying that some things excite our passions. For some of you, maybe, World Scholar’s Cup is that kind of cause; others of you might thrill to the fight against global climate change, a big boss in the Forgotten Land, or the harmful impacts of social media. But what would it take to have your feelings about something (or somewhere or someone) <i>re-ignited</i>? Under what circumstances does a person leave a project, then return to it with new zeal?</li>
	
			<li>Not long ago, the future beckoned with open arms. Many people at the beginning of the 20th century–and even at its conclusion!–were certain that social and technological progress would continue endlessly, that there was a kind of Moore’s Law for everything. (At least one influential thinker <a href="https://aiadventures.net/summaries/moores-law-for-everything" target="_blank">still believes this</a>.) Consider the musical selection “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMYtFe8adKA" target="_blank">Counting Up to Twenty</a>” as just one example of this boundless optimism. In those not-so-long-ago times, forecasts for the future were exuberant—and sometimes even exuberantly dull. How do you see the future, and how does your view compare to that of the older people in your life?</li>
	
			<li>“The best is yet to be,” wrote the English poet Robert Browning, a phrase often quoted (out of context) to evoke a sense of possibility and hope. But we now live, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-speech-cognitive-state-ezra-klein-podcast-1972996" target="_blank">many people are saying</a>, in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23632673/against-doomerism" target="_blank">pessimistic age</a>–in which some people even avoid having children to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2024/05/climate-scientists-crisis-decision-have-children-kids-childbearing/" target="_blank">protect them</a> from the grim days ahead. If you met someone who was sure the future would be full of suffering, would you try to give them hope again? If so, what would you tell them?</li>
	
			<li>Take a step back from the broader future to zoom in on small things that can also be recalled to life with new vitality: musical bands, TV shows, even products once abandoned to museums and overstock warehouses. (For instance, walk around your school and may spot someone buzzing about with a film camera.) We’ll investigate them more later in this outline, but, for now, what other dead or derelict institutions, products, or trends do you think will become popular again in our lifetimes? Is there a restaurant that you and your family miss that you wish would be revived—and how much effort would you be willing to put into that revival?</li>
	
			<li>While actual resurrection is <i>probably</i> still impossible, individuals can still be recalled to life in different ways, as in this <a href="https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/22/a-tale-of-two-cities/108/book-the-first-recalled-to-lifechapter-1-the-period/" target="_blank">first book</a> of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>–whether it is after incarceration, illness, or a different kind of darkness. Do you know anyone who has found a new lease on life in this way? How can we best support someone who is starting over again?</li>

        	<li>In 2009, the Australian government announced an ambitious project to provide super-fast fiber-based Internet to 93% of the population; in 2013, it revised the plan to reuse existing copper wire; in 2025, many Australians <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/23/australian_national_broadband_network_complete/" target="_blank">still have no (or slow) Internet</a>. First promise big things, then revise the promise to make them little things, then don’t finish them anyway. This isn’t (we hope) a description of the World Scholar’s Cup curriculum release process, but a pattern of behavior for governments all over the world. Discuss with your team: is it better to underpromise and overdeliver, or vice versa?</li>
        
        	<li>Don’t worry, Australia—you’re not alone. (More on loneliness later.) In Canada, a proposed high-speed rail network had its target speed slashed before being rebranded as a <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/high-speed-rail/" target="_blank">high <i>frequency</i></a> network. In many developed countries, ambitious projects have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/bertha-seattle-infrastructure-trouble-megaprojects" target="_blank">gone out of fashion</a> in favor of slow, incremental ones. Check out the mega projects below, as well as those from your own country, then discuss with your team: is this shift in approach justified? How might megaprojects (or their failure) affect the way people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02513625.2019.1630189#d1e235" target="_blank">perceive progress?</a> And are some countries more consistently successful at these projects?</li>

       		<li>Sometimes social distancing is the problem. In 2023, the World Health Organization declared loneliness a pressing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern" target="_blank">global health threat</a>.

        	<li>Some countries have tried tackling the problem with technology—and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/japan-loneliness-aging-robots-technology_n_5b72873ae4b0530743cd04aa" target="_blank">none more so than Japan</a>.

Should we want it to?</li>
        
        	<li>During the Covid pandemic, podcasts exploded in popularity. Their hosts (or at least their subtly-enhanced voices) became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/07/tragic-but-true-have-podcasters-replaced-our-real-friends" target="_blank">many people’s closest friends</a> in a solitary time.

        	<li>Speaking of bullets, the man who eventually assassinated American President James Garfield, Charles Guiteau, was certain they had a close personal connection (which, of course, Garfield never knew about.) The Internet has <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/modern-mentality/201810/is-social-media-making-you-lonely" target="_blank">driven a surge</a> in these one-sided “parasocial” relationships.

Could you design an algorithm to craft a healthier, happier society—and would it be successful?</li>
        	
        	<li>How often do you pick up your phone to check a fact or answer a question during a meal with friends or family? Can you imagine living in a world where things just—stay mysterious, and where you have no idea what is happening a thousand miles away? Researchers have found that the oversaturation of news, especially of negative stories, <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/strain-media-overload" target="_blank">leads to constant stress</a> and a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200512-how-the-news-changes-the-way-we-think-and-behave" target="_blank">skewed worldview</a>, especially when they contain <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychology-through-technology/202402/traumatic-media-overload-could-impact-our-mental-health" target="_blank">violent images and videos</a>.

			<li>A butterfly flaps its wings and a hurricane (eventually) pops to life on the other side of the world. Small changes can have large impacts that may not be as random (or unpredictable) as they seem. Explore the field of chaos theory, which attempts to understand how complex systems are built up from simple parts, then discuss with your team: are there examples of such systems in society, and can they help us tell the future? Be sure to explore the following terms:</li>

        	<li>Rasputin may be the most famous Russian monk, but he wasn’t the first to opine on geopolitical affairs. In the 16th century, his distant (and also lushly-bearded) predecessor Filofei proposed (in letters to a young prince named Vassilij) that Russia could be the third Rome. Consider what he meant then and what the implications of his suggestion might be today, then discuss with your team: could there be another Rome in our own era, and would it be good for the world if there were? Would Greenland be part of it? Be sure to explore the following concepts:</li>

				</ul>
			</ul>
        
        	<li>Rome isn’t the only empire that keeps popping back up. Like certain movie franchises, a great empire can only fall once, but it can be revived—usually unsuccessfully—many times. Study the history of second chances at imperial grandeur. What were they trying to emulate or continue, and how close did they come to succeeding? Did any last longer than the regimes they sought to restart?</li>

       		<li>In Isaac Asimov’s <i>Foundation</i> series, the great Galactic Empire is falling. Thirty thousand years of darkness and ruin await—even Palpatine couldn’t have lived that long—until a man who can predict the future using math comes up with a weird plan: a colony of librarians who, if left alone on the fringe of the known universe to write a great encyclopedia, could shorten the Dark Ages to a “mere” thousand years. Discuss with your team: would librarians be a good choice of profession for those entrusted to restart a great civilization? If not librarians, then who? And how much do you think math—and big data—can and should be used to predict the future?</li>
       		
       		<li>Sometime in 2025, a dead airline will return to the skies. A private company is planning to de-extinct the once-legendary airline brand Pan Am for some <a href="https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/pan-am-revival-tour-flights-2025" target="_blank">very expensive charter flights</a>, with hints of bringing it back in a bigger fashion down the line. And, speaking of fashion, Pan Am has already been revived as <a href="https://insideretail.asia/2022/08/31/onetime-airline-pan-am-reimagined-in-south-korea-as-a-lifestyle-brand/" target="_blank">a South Korean clothing brand</a>. Consider the examples below of other brand names that have been brought back from the dead to sell new products and services–even if they are unconnected to the companies that spawned them. Discuss with your team: is this kind of branding dishonest, and what derelict brands or companies would you want to reintroduce–and in what forms?</li>

       		<li>The Hangzhou Round famously caught fire. But what is a fire, and how does it burn? Begin your exploration of this topic with the terms below:</li>
       		<ul style="margin: 0px;">
				<ul style="margin: 0px; line-height: 80%;">
					<li>oxidization | ignition | combustion | flash point | convection</li>
					<li>fire triangle | fire tetrahedron | flame | fuel</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
						
			<li>Next, explore the history of fire. Was it discovered or invented, and by whom and when? How often is this history <a href="https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought" target="_blank">revised</a>? (<a href="https://archive.is/a8cjb" target="_blank">alternate link</a>) Discuss with your team: if someone had first come up with fire in 2024, would they have been able to patent or copyright it? (And would it have been subject to international copyright laws?) Did anyone “own” fire in a similar way in the ancient world?</li>
			
			<li>One way or another, people did start the fire. While fires can occur naturally, different methods—such as matches, and episodes of the Apprentice—now allow us to start them at will. Investigate historical fire-starting, from stones and flint to ants and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZNsfx7soUs" target="_blank">lenses</a>.

			<li>A fire that no one can extinguish: not Los Angeles in 2025 but a deadly weapon in Byzantine Greece. Learn the science and history of <a href="https://history.howstuffworks.com/world-history/greek-fire.htm" target="_blank">Greek fire</a>. Would it still be a useful weapon today, and what are its closest modern-day equivalents? Be sure to study the examples of napalm, thermite, and white phosphorus.</li>
	
			<li>For early humans, fire was surely useful for cooking raw Macrauchenia and for fending off saber-toothed tigers—but could it also have been used to create the ancient equivalent of cartoons? Consider this research into the prehistoric use of fire as <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ice-age-artists-may-have-used-firelight-to-animate-carvings-180979943/" target="_blank">a tool for animation</a>, then discuss with your team: is this a form of art (or entertainment) that we should be reviving today? Can you imagine other forms of storytelling that utilize natural phenomena—for instance, strong winds—in a similar way?</li>
	
			<li>On New Year’s Eve ___, a tragic fireworks accident killed many and maimed more in ____. Every year, those blanks can be filled in differently, most recently with <i>2024</i> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-fireworks-explosion-culture-62e7e02fb018a8c29d4298c6f2804f1b" target="_blank"><i>Hawaii</i></a>. Though dangerous, fireworks remain popular around the world. Research their history with your team. What were the earliest fireworks—widely believed to have been invented in China—made of, and what was their purpose? When and how did they become the bright and colorful displays they are today?  Discuss with your team: should they be outlawed, and, if so, is there something that could replace them in the popular imagination?</li>
			
			<li>Music can be explosive; it can also be about explosives. Listen to the works below to see how the creators treat fireworks in their music. Are they celebrating or criticizing them, or is it impossible to tell? What instruments or lyrics do they use to channel the feeling of fireworks?</li>

			<li>If you’ve ever gone camping on a cold night, you might have gathered around a fire with your friends to toast tasty s’mores and tell tasty stories. Every so often, someone needs to put more wood in the fire to keep it from going out—they are tending it. Early towns and villages had people assigned to this task full-time, because it was much harder to restart a fire than to keep it going. Explore the <a href="https://library.acropolis.org/keeping-the-flame-alive/" target="_blank">mythologies that emerged in early civilizations</a> around the idea of keeping a fire alive and well, then discuss with your team: is there anything else similar to fire that is easier to keep alive than to restart once it is gone—and, if so, who tends to it?</li>

        	<li>JFK’s most famous speech may have been about going to the moon, but that giant leap was a lot easier to achieve than peace in his (or our) time. Watch these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf4eQhrHbKA" target="_blank">selected excerpts</a> from his “peace speech” at American University, then discuss with your team: is it possible to give a passionate speech about peace, and, if so, does JFK succeed here? Is he naïve about the role of the United States in world affairs? Then consider the speeches listed below and discuss with your team: are they, too, inspirational—or naïve? Can they be both?</li>

       		<li>“Time of death,” says a doctor on TV, after frantic efforts to get someone’s heart pumping again fail, “5:11 am.” If it were only that simple! Research is increasingly suggesting that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/17/1082937/what-is-death/" target="_blank">death is a complex process</a>, sometimes reversible—sometimes not. Explore the differences between resuscitation and resurrection, then, without getting too dark, discuss with your team: how much of a person’s mind needs to be intact for it to be a good idea to keep them alive—and who should decide?

			<li>“I did it again” isn’t always an oops; it’s often a plan. Many artists re-record and sometimes greatly revise and recreate their own past works. Taylor Swift’s new “Version(s)” of her old albums have set the charts on fire even though most of her songs are little-changed—but for some, her success has had <a href="https://uclawreview.org/2024/03/27/look-what-you-made-them-do-the-impact-of-taylor-swifts-re-recording-project-on-record-labels/" target="_blank">consequences</a>. Discuss with your team: what is the right time to re-release existing works, and to what degree should the original creator need to be involved?</li>
	
			<li>In 2023, electronic music artist Porter Robinson created the “Po-uta” voice bank to allow future artists to create songs using his voice. Check out <a href="https://www.vocaloid.com/en/creator/meets_001/" target="_blank">this interview</a> where he explains his motivations as well as the demonstration song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqTq1P6y70Q" target="_blank">Humansongs</a>”. Similarly, some Hollywood actors are creating <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/06/screen-actors-guild-artificial-intelligence-strike-digital-doubles.html" target="_blank">digital clones of themselves</a> with the help of AI—some to preserve their likeness for the future, others to accept multiple gigs at once. Explore these technologies with your team, then discuss with your team: when (and how much) does it matter whether an artwork is created by the artist themselves or their digital clone?</li>
	
			<li>For years, people have wondered what Beethoven’s tenth symphony—the “Unfinished”—would have sounded like if he had lived a little bit longer. Now, an AI has <a data-savepage-href="https://www.beethovenx-ai.com" href="https://www.beethovenx-ai.com/" target="_blank">taken on the task</a>, with substantial human involvement. Read about the effort, then compare the outcome to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-9MbCLsbSg" target="_blank">this earlier attempt</a> by the composer Barry Cooper. Which seems more authentic to you—and which has more artistic value? Are there other unfinished works you would like to see completed in a similar way?</li>

Afterward, discuss with your team: should more creators communicate openly with the public while developing new works of fiction, theater, and art? Should we have done that with these outlines?</li>

			<li>Like dormant volcanoes, not every war can be suppressed forever. Treaties break; truces fail to hold. Explore why some periods of conflict lasted as long as they did, then discuss with your team: what does it take to “put out” a war so that it doesn’t reignite? To what extent were there periods of quiet within the larger scope of the violence around them? Is the best way to achieve a lasting peace for one side to win a conflict decisively?</li>

       		<li>During a difficult conversation, you look down and see what looks like a giraffe in the carpet. This phenomenon—the human brain’s ability to find patterns and images even where none exist—is called pareidolia. Research how pareidolia works. Then discuss with your team: would humanity be better off if we only saw what was literally in front of us? When does pareidolia most hurt us—and when does it most help us?</li>
       		
       		<li>Are some settings better for creativity? “Beginnings are contagious there, they’re always setting stages there”—the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbbR5qvfC8g" target="_blank">Once Upon a Time in New York City</a>” praises the Big Apple as a place for dreamers, fervent with opportunities for reinvention. Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, among many other writers of their era, hung out with other writers in Paris. Explore the <a href="https://thesalonhost.com/brief-history-of-salons/" target="_blank">history of the salon</a>, or gatherings where creative and intellectual spirits meet frequently to share and develop ideas, then discuss with your team: is there a place in your country that beckons to the creatively-minded? Has the salon been replaced in the modern world by the Internet—and if so, how?</li>
       		
       		<li>Consider the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3662866/" target="_blank">neurobiology of imagination</a>: what actually happens in your brain when you are imagining things? Explore the terms below, then hypothesize with your team: how might a person’s imagination be affected if you alter one or more of these elements? How do they relate to emotions, belief, suppositions, and fantasy?</li>

       		<li>Research drugs that stimulate the imagination, then discuss with your team: should all these be considered illegal hallucinogens? Be sure to consider how and to what degree a hallucination varies from a simulation, a rehearsal, or other acts of the imagination. For instance, when is a daydream a hallucination?</li>
       		
       		<li>While how to become more imaginative is a question most frequently answered by self-help publications and clinics that also offer derriere implants, some mainstream treatments and <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/04/cover-science-creativity" target="_blank">techniques</a> do exist and are practiced in the real world. Explore the following approaches and terms then discuss with your team: which do you think would be most effective?</li>
       		<ul style="margin: 0px;">

       		<li>One used by writers is called “writing with constraints”. If their options are limited—for instance, if they cannot use the letter A in a story—someone struggling to put words on a blank page might dodge that first paralyzing moment of decision-making. Artificial limitations “provide a certain level of texture against which a metaphorical match can more easily be struck,”  says the writer <a href="https://lithub.com/five-writers-on-how-writing-with-creative-constraints-unlocked-their-projects/" target="_blank">Matthew Tomkinson</a>. Many traditional poetic forms—especially strict ones, such as haiku—are examples of this approach. Read about others here across different genres, including those of the French Oulipo movement, then learn more about the selections below. Afterward, discuss with your team: should more creators use this technique? When they do, should it be advertised to the public? Would you want to try it for your World Scholar’s Cup writing event?</li>

What do these terms mean, and Is there such a thing as a “future” riff—a musical shortcut that helps to set a time and place, but in this case for a time and place that haven’t happened yet?

       		<li>The future began in 1909—or, at least, futurism did. When Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti <a href="https://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/" target="_blank">coined the word 'futurism'</a>, he imagined a world of speed, danger, and beauty. To him, this future could be found in the swift efficiency of the automobile. Today’s futurists look further ahead to artificial intelligence, space travel, and the blending of human and machine. Explore the origin and development of futurism, then discuss with your team: how is it different from science fiction—or is it? Should we value works that predicted futures that never came to be?

       		<li>Reconstruct, reimagine, reignite: consider the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/aug/03/david-irvine-upcycled-thrift-store-paintings-in-pictures" target="_blank">works of David Irvine</a> as examples of how new art can be made from old things, even those found in thrift stores. Will the future be built from bits of the past, or from materials we haven’t even imagined yet? What would you prefer to see?</li>

       		<li>Work with your team to imagine yourselves reuniting in 20 years; you can even use AI tools online to create images of what you’ll like in the future.
